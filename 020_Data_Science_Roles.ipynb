    "## I. Data Science Team\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hiring the right team for the job\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re selling cutting-edge appliances, hire **researchers**. If you’re innovating in recipes to sell food at scale, you need people who \n",
    "\n",
    "- figure out what’s worth cooking / what the objectives are (**decision-makers** and **product managers**), \n",
    "- understand the suppliers and the customers (**domain experts** and **social scientists**), \n",
    "- can process ingredients at scale (**data engineers** and **analysts**), \n",
    "- can try many different ingredient-appliance combinations quickly to generate potential recipes (**applied ML engineers**), \n",
    "- can check that the quality of the recipe is good enough to serve (**statisticians**), \n",
    "- turn a potential recipe into millions of dishes served efficiently (**software engineers**), \n",
    "- keep the interdisciplinary team on track (**project/program managers/leaders**), \n",
    "- ensure that your dishes stay top notch even if the delivery truck brings you a ton of potatoes instead of the rice you ordered (**reliability engineers**).\n",
    "\n",
    "While these needn’t be separate individuals, be sure you’ve got each role covered. And before you fling your rotten tomato at me for providing such an incomplete caricature, I’ll freely admit that there’s much more to say about hiring for **applied machine learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of outsourcing, if your team has tried all existing tools and can’t make a recipe that meets your business objectives, it makes sense to think about adding skills in building appliances (**researcher**). Whether or not you hire that person to your permanent staff or outsource the job to an experienced algorithms research firm depends on the scale and maturity of your operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to connect with researchers is that your prototype is so successful that using custom-built appliances makes sense at the massive scale you’re lucky enough to operate at. (What a great problem to have!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applied data science** is a team sport that’s highly interdisciplinary. Diversity of perspective matters! In fact, perspective and attitude matter at least as much as education and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have the ability to get data before it makes sense to talk about data analysis. If you’re dealing with small datasets, **data engineering** is essentially entering some numbers into a spreadsheet. When you operate at a more impressive scale, data engineering becomes a sophisticated discipline in its own right. Someone on your team will need to take responsibility for dealing with the tricky engineering aspects of delivering data that the rest of your staff can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Decision-Maker\n",
    "\n",
    "Before hiring that PhD-trained data scientist, make sure you have a decision-maker who understands the art and science of **data-driven decision-making**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Decision-making skills have to be in place before a team can get value out of data.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This individual is responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying decisions worth making with data, \n",
    "- Framing them (everything from designing metrics to calling the shots on statistical assumptions), and \n",
    "- Determining the required level of analytical rigor based on potential impact on the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Look for a deep thinker who doesn’t keep saying, “Oh, whoops, that didn’t even occur to me as I was thinking through this decision.” They’ve already thought of it. And that. And that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the next hire is... everyone already working with you. Everyone is qualified to look at data and get inspired, the only thing that might be missing is a bit of familiarity with software that’s well-suited for the job. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve ever looked at a digital photograph, you’ve done data visualization and analytics. Learning to use tools like R and Python is just an upgrade over MS Paint for data visualization; they’re simply more versatile tools for looking at a wider variety of datasets than just red-green-blue pixel matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember is that `you shouldn’t come to conclusions beyond your data`. That takes specialist training. Here’s all you can say about it: **“This is what is in my dataset.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Expert Analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "This person can look at more data faster. The game here is speed, exploration, discovery... fun! This is not the role concerned with rigor and careful conclusions. Instead, this is the person who helps your team get eyes on as much of your data as possible so that your decision-maker can get a sense of what’s worth pursuing with more care.\n",
    "\n",
    "`The job here is speed, encountering potential insights as quickly as possible.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be counterintuitive, but don’t staff this role with your most reliable engineers who write gorgeous, robust code. The job here is speed, encountering potential insights as quickly as possible, and unfortunately those who obsess over code quality may find it too difficult to zoom through the data fast enough to be useful in this role. Those who obsess over code quality may find it difficult to be useful in this role.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does “great code” means for descriptive analytics? Great is “fast and humble” here. If fast-but-sloppy coders don’t get much love, they’ll leave your company and you’ll wonder why you don’t have a finger on the pulse of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Statistician\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve got all these folks cheerfully exploring data, we’d better have someone around who can prevent the team from making unwarranted conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Statisticians help decision-makers come to conclusions safely beyond the data.`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your machine learning system worked in one dataset, all you can safely conclude is that it worked in that dataset. Will it work when it’s running in production? Should you launch it? You need some extra skills to deal with those questions. Statistical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to make serious decisions where we don’t have perfect facts, let’s slow down and take a careful approach. Statisticians help decision-makers come to conclusions safely beyond the data analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Applied Machine Learning Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "An applied AI / machine learning engineer’s best attribute is not an understanding of how algorithms work. `Their job is to use them, not build them.` (That’s what researchers do.) Expertise at wrangling code that gets existing algorithms to accept and churn through your datasets is what you’re looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides quick coding fingers, look for a personality that can cope with failure. You almost never know what you’re doing, even if you think you do. You run the data through a bunch of algorithms as quickly as possible and see if it seems to be working... with the reasonable expectation that you’ll fail a lot before you succeed. A huge part of the job is dabbling blindly, and it takes a certain kind of personality to enjoy that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfectionists tend to struggle as ML engineers. Because your business problem’s not in a textbook, you can’t know in advance what will work, so you can’t expect to get a perfect result on the first go. That’s okay, just try lots of approaches as quickly as possible and iterate towards a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of “running the data through algorithms”... what data? The inputs your analysts identified as potentially interesting, of course. That’s why analysts make sense as an earlier hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there’s a lot of tinkering, `it’s important for the machine learning engineer to have a deep respect for the part of the process where rigor is vital: assessment`. Does the solution actually work on new data? Luckily, you made a wise choice with your previous hire, so all you have to do is pass the baton to the statistician.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest applied ML engineers have a very good sense of how long it takes to apply various approaches. When a potential ML hire can rank options by the time it takes to try them on various kinds of datasets, be impressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Data Scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "`A data scientist is someone who is a full expert in all of the three preceding roles.` Not everyone uses this definition: you’ll see job applications out there with people calling themselves “data scientist” when they have only really mastered one of the three, so it’s worth checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientist are full experts in all of the three previous roles. This role is in position 7. because hiring the true three-in-one is an expensive option. If you can hire one within budget, it’s a great idea, but if you’re on a tight budget, consider upskilling and growing your existing single-role specialists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Analytics Manager / Data Science Leader\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytics manager is the goose that lays the golden egg: `they’re a hybrid between the data scientist and the decision-maker`. Their presence on the team acts as a force-multiplier, ensuring that your data science team isn’t off in the weeds instead of adding value to your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "`The decision-maker + data scientist hybrid is a force-multiplier.` Unfortunately, they’re rare and hard to hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "This person is kept awake at night by questions like, “How do we design the right questions? How do we make decisions? How do we best allocate our experts? What’s worth doing? Will the skills and data match the requirements? How do we ensure good input data?”\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re lucky enough to hire one of these, hold on to them and never let them go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Qualitative Expert / Social Scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes your decision-maker is a brilliant leader, manager, motivator, influencer, or navigator of organizational politics... but unskilled in the art and science of decision-making. Decision-making is so much more than a talent. If your decision-maker hasn’t honed their craft, they might do more damage than good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of firing an unskilled decision-maker, you can augment them with a qualitative expert. Don’t fire an unskilled decision-maker, augment them. You can hire them an upgrade in the form of a helper. The qualitative expert is here to supplement their skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "This person typically has a social science and data background — behavioral economists, neuroeconomists, and JDM psychologists receive the most specialized training, but self-taught folk can also be good at it. `The job is to help the decision maker clarify ideas, examine all the angles, and turn ambiguous intuitions into well-thought-through instructions in language that makes it easy for the rest of the team to execute on.`\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t realize how valuable social scientists are. They’re usually better equipped than data scientists to translate the intuitions and intentions of a decision-maker into concrete metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The qualitative expert doesn’t call any of the shots. Instead, they ensure that the decision-maker has fully grasped the shots available for calling. `They’re also a trusted advisor, a brainstorming companion, and a sounding board for a decision-maker.` Having them on board is a great way to ensure that the project starts out in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Researcher\n",
    "\n",
    "Many hiring managers think their first team member needs to be the ex-professor, but actually you don’t need those PhD folk unless you already know that the industry is not going to supply the algorithms that you need. Most teams won’t know that in advance, so it makes more sense to do things in the right order: before building yourself that space pen, first check whether a pencil will get the job done. `Get started first and if you find that the available off-the-shelf solutions aren’t giving you much love, then you should consider hiring researchers.`\n",
    "\n",
    "If a researcher is your first hire, you probably won’t have the right environment to make good use of them.\n",
    "Don’t bring them in right off the bat. It’s better to wait until your team is developed enough to have figured out that what they need a researcher for. Wait till you’ve exhausted all the available tools before hiring someone to build you expensive new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Additional personnel\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the roles we looked at, here are some of my favorite people to welcome to a **decision intelligence project**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Domain expert\n",
    "- Ethicist\n",
    "- Software engineer\n",
    "- Reliability engineer\n",
    "- UX designer\n",
    "- Interactive visualizer / graphic designer\n",
    "- Data collection specialist\n",
    "- Data product manager\n",
    "- Project / program manager\n",
    "- SCRUM master\n",
    "\n",
    "Many projects can’t do without them — `the only reason they aren’t listed in the top 11 is that decision intelligence is not their primary business`. Instead, they are geniuses at their own discipline and have learned enough about data and decision-making to be remarkably useful to your project. Think of them as having their own major or specialization, but enough love for decision intelligence that they chose to minor in it."

    "## Wide versus deep\n",
    "\n",
    "What the two roles (**statistician** and **machine learning engineer**) have in common is that they both provide high-effort solutions to specific problems. If the problems they tackle aren’t worth solving, you end up wasting their time and your money. A frequent lament among business leaders is, “Our data science group is useless.” And the problem usually lies in an absence of **analytics** expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statisticians** and **machine learning engineers** are narrow-and-deep workers — the shape of a rabbit hole, incidentally — so it’s really important to point them at problems that deserve the effort. If your experts are carefully solving the wrong problems, your investment in data science will suffer low returns. To ensure that you can make good use of narrow-and-deep experts, you either need to be sure you already have the right problem or you need a wide-and-shallow approach to finding one. You need **data anlysts**."

    "## II. How to Begin\n",
    "\n",
    "### Begin with the decision-maker\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaders, figure out who’s calling the shots. If it’s you, then let’s designate you The Decision-Maker for this project. Otherwise, delegate the position to someone else and ask them to read the rest of this while you play outside in the sunshine.\n",
    "\n",
    "`The right first step is to focus on outputs and objectives.` The right time to think about your goals is at the very beginning, while your project is still a puppy! **Define success!**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytics might a better fit for you\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied AI requires you to have to have a very clear vision of what your model needs to grow up into (and why), then you have to train it towards that. If you don’t know what you want, head to the font of inspiration instead: **analytics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spend some time figuring out what looks promising enough to pursue, then come back to machine learning when you’re ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, analytics uses some of the same math, so you wouldn’t be lying if you told your friends you’re using ML/AI algorithms (though you’re not building ML/AI systems). `Many people who think they want ML/AI actually only need analytics`. The latter is a great idea for all projects, while the former is good for only certain kinds. If you’re unsure, go for the sure thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DS Lead\n",
    "\n",
    "Leadership in data science isn’t just leadership with a semester of numbers sprinkled on top. It’s its own strange beast. Not only must you have a deep understanding of decision-making and how information should drive actions, but you need a keen nose for the nuances of how to usefully impact your particular business domain and, as if that weren’t enough, you also need to understand the ecosystem of diverse skills that need to come together to make a large-scale data science project successful. And that’s just the minimum for entry into this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a pretty high bar, and not everyone who leads data science teams meets it. Employers, how do you know if you’re hiring the real deal to lead your data team? What if your team already has bad data science leadership? How could you tell? There’s hardly any wisdom about this role for you to lean on. Whom could you even ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, when I chat with folks across industry, I keep hearing the same story: “Our data scientists are useless! All they do is sit around publishing papers.” Will we have enough skilled leaders to prevent this all-too-common phenomenon? If data scientists don’t prove themselves valuable, they won’t be in those jobs for long.\n",
    "\n",
    "`It’s unfair to expect that a freshly-minted science PhD knows how to contribute meaningfully to business.` That’s not what they spent all those years learning. Without guidance from someone who understands what data science involves and knows how to connect data with the business, the deck is stacked against them. To make sure data science is not a bubble, we urgently need specialized leadership. Where will it come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Scienctist vs. Data Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "A **data scientist** is only as good as the data they have access to. Most companies store their data in variety of formats across databases and text files. This is where **data engineers** come in — they build pipelines that transform that data into formats that data scientists can use. Data engineers are just as important as data scientists, but tend to be less visible because they tend to be further from the end product of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **data science** field is incredibly broad, encompassing everything from cleaning data to deploying predictive models. However, it’s rare for any single data scientist to be working across the spectrum day to day. Data scientists usually focus on a few areas, and are complemented by a team of other scientists and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data engineering** is also a broad field, but any individual data engineer doesn’t need to know the whole spectrum of skills. In this section, we’ll sketch the broad outlines of data engineering, then walk through more specific descriptions that illustrate specific data engineering roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data engineer transforms data into a useful format for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data engineering skills\n",
    "\n",
    "A data engineer needs to be good at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Architecting distributed systems\n",
    "- Creating reliable pipelines\n",
    "- Combining data sources\n",
    "- Architecting data stores\n",
    "- Collaborating with data science teams and building the right solutions for them\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we didn’t mention any tools above. Although tools like Hadoop and Spark and languages like Scala and Python are important to data engineering, it’s more important to understand the concepts well and know how to build real-world systems. We’ll continue this focus on concepts over tools throughout this series on data engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Engineering Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "Although data engineers need to have the skills listed above, the day to day of a data engineer will vary depending on the type of company they work for. Broadly, you can classify data engineers into a few categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generalist\n",
    "- Pipeline-centric\n",
    "- Database-centric\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Generalist\n",
    "\n",
    "A generalist data engineer typically works on a small team. Without a data engineer, data analysts and scientsts don’t have anything to analyze, making a data engineer a critical first member of a data science team.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a data engineer is the only data-focused person at a company, they usually end up having to do more end-to-end work. For example, a generalist data engineer may have to do everything from ingesting the data to processing it to doing the final analysis. This requires more data science skill than most data engineers have. However, it also requires less systems architecture knowledge — small teams and companies don’t have a ton of users, so engineering for scale isn’t as important. This is a good role for a data scientist who wants to transition into data engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pipeline-centric\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline-centric data engineers tend to be necessary in mid-sized companies that have complex data science needs. A pipeline-centric data engineer will work with teams of data scientists to transform data into a useful format for analysis. This entails in-depth knowledge of distributed systems and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Database-centric\n",
    "\n",
    "A database-centric data engineer is focused on setting up and populating analytics databases. This involves some work with pipelines, but more work with tuning databases for fast analysis and creating table schemas. This involves ETL work to get data into warehouses. This type of data engineer is usually found at larger companies with many data analysts that have their data distributed across databases."
