    "Cross validation is simply splitting a dataset into two components: a train dataset, which the model is trained on, and a test dataset, which the model is tested on. For example, a default split between these two parts of the dataset is 80-20. A model will be trained on a random 80% of the dataset; then we will evaluate how well it did using the remaining 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since that 20% was never seen by the model during training, it is not optimized for, and we can except model performance \"in the wild\" to be closely approximated by model performance on our training data!"

Hence we can use cross validation—that is, checking the mean squared error of the classifier applied to the test dataset—for, say, every degree polynomial regression function between 1 and 10. Clearly our best-performing model will be somewhere in there!\n",
