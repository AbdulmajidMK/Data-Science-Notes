    "More often than not, companies are not ready for AI. Maybe they hired their first data scientist to less-than-stellar outcomes, or maybe data literacy is not central to their culture. But the most common scenario is that they have not yet built the **infrastructure to implement (and reap the benefits of) the most basic data science algorithms and operations, much less machine learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management teams often assume they can leapfrog best practices for basic data analytics by going directly to adopting artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies. But companies that rush into sophisticated artificial intelligence before reaching a critical mass of automated processes and structured analytics can end up paralyzed. They can become saddled with expensive start-up partnerships, impenetrable black-box systems, cumbersome cloud computational clusters, and open-source toolkits without programmers to write code for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, companies with strong basic analytics — such as sales data and market trends — make breakthroughs in complex and critical areas after layering in artificial intelligence. For example, one telecommunications company we worked with can now predict with 75 times more accuracy whether its customers are about to bolt using machine learning. But the company could only achieve this because it had already automated the processes that made it possible to contact customers quickly and understood their preferences by using more standard analytical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can companies tell if they are really ready for AI and other advanced technologies?\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, managers should ask themselves if they have **automated processes** in problem areas that cost significant money and slow down operations. Companies need to automate repetitive processes involving substantial amounts of data — especially in areas where intelligence from analytics or speed would be an advantage. Without automating such data feeds first, companies will discover their new AI systems are reaching the wrong conclusions because they are analyzing out-of-date data. Without basic automation, strategic visions of solving complex problems at the touch of a button remain elusive.\n",
    "- Once processes critical to achieving an efficiency or goal are automated, managers need to **develop structured analytics as well as centralize data processes** so that the way data is collected is standardized and can be entered only once. With more centralized information architectures, all systems refer back to the primary “source of truth,” updates propagate to the entire system, and decisions reflect a single view of a customer or issue. A set of structured analytics provides retail category managers, for instance, with a complete picture of historic customer data; shows them which products were popular with which customers; what sold where; which products customers switched between; and to which they remained loyal.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these standard structured analytics are integrated with artificial intelligence, it’s possible to comprehensively predict, explain, and prescribe customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies are just beginning to discover the many different ways that AI technologies can potentially reinvent businesses. But one thing is already clear: they must invest time and money to be prepared with sufficiently automated and structured data analytics in order to take full advantage of the new technologies. Like it or not, you can’t afford to skip the basics."

    "## People and Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "People and organization are other than data components helping in successful AI strategy implementation. Data and Analytics should be the pulse of the organization, incorporated into all key decisions across sales, marketing, supply chain, customer experience, and other core functions. What’s the best way to build effective D&A capabilities? Start by developing a strategy across the entire enterprise that includes a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish and how success will be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to understand that D&A teams are not data warehouses that perform back-office functions. Your D&A function should be a key contributor to the development and execution of the business strategy by supplying insights into key areas, such as employees and customers, unmet market opportunities, emerging trends in the external environment, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leadership teams must recognize that being successful will take courage, because once they embark on the journey, the insights from data analytics will often point to the need for decisions that could require a course correction. Leaders need to be honest with themselves about their willingness to incorporate the insights into their decision making, and hold themselves and their teams accountable for doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gartner estimates D&A projects falter 60% of the time. Why? We’ve observed that it’s often because they are not supported by the right organizational structure and talent and are not aligned with the business strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some organizations have D&A capabilities spread across functions, or rely on a few data scientists to provide insights. Some are too reliant on technology tool kits and rigid architectures, and not enough on creating the right environment to effectively leverage people with the right expertise to drive D&A projects forward. These sorts of models usually are not capable of achieving truly transformative D&A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of a large global life sciences company that spent a significant sum of money building an advanced analytics platform without first determining what it was supposed to do. Executives allowed their technology team to acquire a lot of products, but no one understood what the advanced tools were supposed to accomplish or how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally structured systems, processes, and people devoted to D&A can be a competitive advantage, but clearly many organizations are missing this big opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "While structures vary, the team should be seamlessly integrated with the company’s existing providers and consumers of D&A, operating in cohesion with non-D&A colleagues — people who really understand both the business challenges and how the business works — to set and work toward realistic and relevant strategic goals. The teams should also have the complete support of executive leadership, and their goals should be fully aligned with the business strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an age where data is created on a scale far beyond the human mind’s ability to process it, business leaders need D&A they can trust to inform their most important decisions — not just to reduce costs but also to achieve growth. And the best will use D&A to anticipate what their customers will want or need before they even know they want or need it."

    "Think of AI as the top of a [pyramid of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html).

    "All of that is awesome and very useful. (Some companies do end up painstakingly custom-building your entire pyramid so they can showcase their work. They are heroes.) However, under the strong influence of the current AI hype, people try to plug in data that’s dirty & full of gaps, that spans years while changing in format and meaning, that’s not understood yet, that’s structured in ways that don’t make sense, and expect those tools to magically handle it. And maybe some day soon that will be the case; I see & applaud efforts in that direction. Until then, it’s worth building a solid foundation for your AI pyramid of needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to remember that good performance on data set doesn’t guarantee a machine learning system will perform well in real product scenarios. Most people in AI forget that the hardest part of building a new AI solution or product is not the AI or algorithms — it’s the data collection and labeling. Standard datasets can be used as validation or a good starting point for building a more tailored solution."

    "We have training data — surely, now we can do machine learning? Maybe, if you’re trying to internally predict churn; no, if the result is going to be customer-facing. We need to have a (however primitive) A/B testing or experimentation framework in place, so we can deploy incrementally to avoid disasters and get a rough estimate of the effects of the changes before they affect everybody. This is also the right time to put a very simple baseline in place (for recommender systems, this would be e.g. ‘most popular’, then ‘most popular for your user segment’ — the very annoying but effective ‘stereotype before personalization’).\n",

Weather & census data are my go-tos. And no — as powerful as it is, deep learning doesn’t automatically do this for you. Bringing in new signals (feature creation, not feature engineering) is what can improve your performance by leaps and bounds. It’s worth spending some time here, even if as data scientists we’re excited about moving on to the next level in the pyramid."

You might get some big improvements in production, or you might not.

    "## MVPs and Agile Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science hierarchy of needs is not an excuse to build disconnected, over-engineered infrastructure for a year. Just like when building a traditional MVP (minimally viable product), you start with a small, vertical section of your product and you make it work well end-to-end. You can build its pyramid, then grow it horizontally. For example, at Jawbone, we started with sleep data and built its pyramid: instrumentation, ETL, cleaning & organization, label capturing and definitions, metrics (what’s the average # of hours people sleep every night? What about naps? What’s a nap?), cross-segment analyses all the way to data stories and machine learning-driven data products (automatic sleep detection). We later extended this to steps, then food, weather, workouts, social network & communication — one at a time. We did not build an all-encompassing infrastructure without ever putting it to work end-to-end."
