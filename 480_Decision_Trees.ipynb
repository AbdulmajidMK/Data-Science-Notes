    "**Decision trees** are `supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression`. Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, `trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships`; on the other hand, `they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset`. By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, **ensemble methods** take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. **Ensemble methods** are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to use Python to train **decision trees** and **tree-based models** with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library. You'll understand the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrate how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets. Finally, you'll also understand how to tune the most influential hyperparameters in order to get the most out of your models."
