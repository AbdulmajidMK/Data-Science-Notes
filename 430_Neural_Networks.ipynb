    "An **artificial neural network** (or neural network for short) is a predictive model motivated by the way the brain operates. Think of the brain as a collection of neurons wired together. Each neuron looks at the outputs of the other neurons that feed into it, does a calculation, and then either fires (if the calculation exceeds some threshhold) or doesn’t (if it doesn’t).\n",

Neural networks can solve a wide variety of problems like handwriting recognition and face detection, and they are used heavily in `deep learning`, one of the trendiest subfields of data science. However, most neural networks are `“black boxes”` — inspecting their details doesn’t give you much understanding of how they’re solving a problem."
