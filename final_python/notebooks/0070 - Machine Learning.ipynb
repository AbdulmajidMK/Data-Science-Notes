    "**Machine learning techniques are used for problems that cannot be solved efficiently or effectively in other ways**. For example, if we need to classify emails as spam or not spam, we need a software program to do this. We could sit down, manually review a ton of email, and write if-statements to perform this task. People have tried. It turns out that this approach is slow, fragile, and not very effective. Instead, we can use machine learning techniques to solve this problem. Specifically, an algorithm like Naive Bayes can learn how to classify email messages as spam and not spam from a large dataset of historical examples of email."

    "From time to time, people trot out a tired claim that computers can “only do what they are told to do.” The claim is taken to mean that computers can only do what their programmers know how to do and can explain to the computer. This claim is false. Computers can perform tasks that their programmers cannot explain to them. Computers can solve tasks that their programmers do not understand. We can break down this paradox with an example of a computer program that learns. Computers do what they are told, but they can be told to develop a capability. Computers can be told to learn."
