    "# Deterministic and Stochastic Machine Learning Algorithms\n",
    "Some machine learning algorithms are `deterministic`. Just like the programming that youâ€™re used to. That means, when the algorithm is given the same dataset, it learns the same model every time. An example is a linear regression or logistic regression algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms are not deterministic; instead, they are `stochastic`. This means that their behavior incorporates elements of randomness. **Stochastic does not mean random**. Stochastic machine learning algorithms are not learning a random model. They are learning a model conditional on the historical data you have provided. Instead, the specific small decisions made by the algorithm during the learning process can vary randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact is that each time the `stochastic machine learning algorithm` is run on the same data, it learns a slightly different model. In turn, the model may make slightly different predictions, and when evaluated using error or accuracy, may have a slightly different performance."
