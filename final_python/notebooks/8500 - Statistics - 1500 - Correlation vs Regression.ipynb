    "# Correlation vs. Regression\n",
    "Correlation and regression are far from the same concept. So, let’s see what the relationship is between correlation analysis and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a single expression that sums it up nicely: **correlation does not imply causation**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Relationship between Variables\n",
    "**Correlation** measures the degree of relationship between two variables. **Regression analysis** is about how one variable affects another or what changes it triggers in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Causality\n",
    "**Correlation** doesn’t capture causality but the degree of interrelation between the two variables. **Regression** is based on causality. It shows no degree of connection, but cause and effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are X and Y Interchangeable?\n",
    "A property of **correlation** is that the correlation between x and y is the same as between y and x. You can easily spot that from the formula, which is symmetrical. **Regressions** of y on x and x on y yield different results. Think about income and education. Predicting income, based on education makes sense, but the opposite does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphical Representation of Correlation and Regression Analysis\n",
    "The two methods have a very different graphical representation. **Linear regression analysis** is known for the best fitting line that goes through the data points and minimizes the distance between them. Whereas, **correlation** is a single point.\n",
