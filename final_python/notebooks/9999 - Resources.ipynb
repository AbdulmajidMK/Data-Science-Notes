    "- [Arthur Samuel's bio](https://history.computer.org/pioneers/samuel.html) - Samuel's papers on machine learning are still worth studying. With great creativity and working essentially alone, doing his own programming, he invented several seminal techniques in rote learning and generalization learning, using such underlying techniques as mutable evaluation functions, hill climbing, and signature tables. A pioneer of artificial intelligence research (best known for his program that played championship level checkers - the world's first self-learning program).\n",
    "- [Francis Galton and his regression to the mean](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2011.00509.x?utm_campaign=G-F5LCVLH01Y&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue+newsletter) - Many words in our statistical lexicon were coined by Galton. For example, correlation and deviate are due to him, as is regression, and he was the originator of terms and concepts such as quartile, decile and percentile, and of the use of median as the midpoint of a distribution. Galton compared the height of children to that of their parents. He found that adult children are closer to average height than their parents are. \"Aa tall child will have parents, on average, less tall than himself\" and that \"a short child will have parents, on average, taller than himself\".
