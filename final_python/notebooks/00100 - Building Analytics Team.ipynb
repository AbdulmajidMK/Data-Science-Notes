    "## Introduction\n",
    "Over the past couple of decades, analytics, for the most part, has evolved from groups of report writers to an assortment of organizational and operating models requiring a wide range of technical and business skills. Even so, many enterprises continue to take old-school approaches to analytics (**Business Intelligence (BI)**), or latch onto the latest technology trends with nary a thought given to the necessary introduction of organizational change and team-based approaches. As those of us who have been in the business long enough have come to realize, `pretty pie charts, beautiful bar charts, and dashing dashboards rarely move the needle on the business. Instead, for the most part what make the change are teams of data curators or \"wranglers,\" data integration professionals, statisticians or data scientists, and visualization experts with an unrelenting passion and unwavering executive support`  - in pursuit of proving hypotheses, performing root-cause diagnostics, predicting customer and market behavior, and prescribing strategic and operational actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data and analytics provide the foundation of reality, truth, and understanding of all business processes and relationships. Data and analytics are the cornerstone of insight and innovation.** Large amounts of data coupled with powerful, easy-to-use, automated and distributed analytics can provide a clear picture of what did actually happen, and provide a framework to predict what is likely to happen in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `optimal environment for decision-making` is one that combines:\n",
    "- experience,\n",
    "- theory,\n",
    "- seasoned intuition with data and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "Analytics (**Advanced analytics** such as **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**) has become a team sport, and such `teams require strong leadership to win` at it: **There's no I in TEAM, but there is in WIN.** (Michael Jordan). `The team or organization is bigger than just the players`. **Advanced analytics** is a broader term encompassing the practice and use of statistics, machine learning, simulation, and optimization. **Artificial intelligence** refers to machine learning and other analytical approaches that learn from data over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define **Advanced analytics** as the practical use of mathematical approaches - formulas, rules, laws, and so on - to either describe the world we work and live in, or to predict phenomena that we would like to understand more clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Intelligence (BI)** involves the reporting and dashboard presentation of historical information to make or support decisions. **Data Warehousing (DW)** refers to the collection, storage, and management of non-changing data elements. The elements in DW are used in a BI system to make or support business decisions. `BI is a presentation layer and DW is a data storage layer`. DW is predicated on carefully curated, analyzed, structured, and indexed data. Only data that is cleaned and structured can be loaded into a data warehouse. Building **Data Lakes** or other **Big Data** environments, the guiding view is to obtain all relevant (all just all) data and store it for further analysis (the analysis methods may be developed over time). In the current **Big Data** environment, all of the planning, structuring, and cost associated with data warehousing may actually be a detriment (harmful) to delivering insights via analytics. [**Five Vs of biga data**: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value](https://www.bbva.com/en/five-vs-big-data/). **Analytics** is a tool to support human intelligence and decision-making (and rather not the ultimate automated environment). Dashboarding, reporting and visual analytics do not represent true analytics, they are variants of BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytics vs. IT Projects\n",
    "`The advanced analytics projects have an IT component, but they are not IT projects by any means`. Indeed, it is this straddling of the domains of data, technology, and business that makes analytics projects particularly challenging, and difficult to get right. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Manage Analytics\n",
    "The contemporary tug-of-war between the traditional and emerging roles of the **Chief Information Officer (CIO)**, **Chief Data Officer (CDO)**, and **Chief Analytics Officer (CAO)** can create all sorts of unproductive drama. Then there's the issue of actually implementing the results. \"Mr. Iknowbetter\" and \"Ms. Thatsnothowwevealwaysdoneit\" always seem to appear at the moment when it's time to start applying the new analytics insights. A sound advice would be on creating and managing an analytics in a form of **Center of Excellence (COE)**. COE will change jobs, and in the process eliminate certain jobs and job content, but the process is to take the robotic work out of a given job and enable people to focus on higher-value work and tasks. Our objective is not to take jobs away from people and give those jobs to robots. It is to make work more engaging and fulfilling for people. The **COE leader and team** will need to learn the broader organization and to build a network of collaborators, sponsors, and allies. This new network, which we will refer to as the **Community of Practice (COP)**, will span the entire organization and global operations. If your organization number is in the thousands, the COE will be less than 50 staff members within the first two years and the COP will be a few hundred in number. `The COE leadership, data scientists, data engineers, data visualization experts, and others cannot be successful without the full-throated support of sponsors, stakeholders, and subject matter experts`.\n",
    "- A transparent and trust-based relationship between all parties is crucial to our joint success. \n",
    "- The new COE and the COP network will need resources and funding. \n",
    "- The executive leadership of the organization will need to publicly support the related data and analytics initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some organizations are focused on the data side of the function and hence they start their efforts by creating the **Chief Data Officer (CDO)** role, while others begin with the **Chief Analytics Officer (CAO)** role. Either starting point is valid and useful:\n",
    "- The **CDO** role is about data management, data governance, and data security, which is a full-time job, certainly for larger organizations. The Chief Data Officer position, by definition, is an `infrastructure and process-oriented position`.\n",
    "- The **CAO** role is about extracting and delivering business value and economic impact from data using analytics, data science and AI and is also a full-time job. The CAO is the driving role. Almost like an internal consulting organization to the company with a focus on realizing operational and functional insights leading to change and improvement. The starting point for a Chief Analytics Officer is `change and competitive advantage`.\n",
    "- The **CDO** role needs analytics to deliver the most business value from data, and the **CAO** role is wholly dependent on the availability of clean, quality, integrated data to function. **CDO**` is an asset management role and `**CAO**` is an action management role`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the mindset changes as well as the organizational process changes that is required to be successful in the journey of becoming data and analytically driven is that by `becoming a data and analytically driven organization`, you at some point realize that the organizational change you seek `is never \"done.\"` This process is evergreen and ever changing. From the perspective of the middle of the processes as described, these processes at the execution level are usually described, organized, and discussed as projects. The larger overall process is typically made up of projects that focus on a specific objective or goals, but the overall process is dynamic and ever changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the pitfalls that most organizations fall prey to is to think that the projects are the process – they are not. The projects are the execution mechanism. The projects are important for organization, management, funding, tracking, and reporting, but the projects are the trees. The forest is the organizational commitment to being analytically driven, the desire to continually improve, the interest in being open to new data and the evolution of the market, services, competition, consumers, patients, and stakeholders. The forest is the strategy to be a market leader. Do not lose sight of the forest for the trees. `The essence of being analytically and data-driven is to be dynamic and guided by empirical evidence and measurable factors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the organization number is in the thousands, spans the globe, and is committed to improving through the use of data and analytics, `the COE team of a handful of people cannot deliver on every possible area of improvement`. There are two areas of augmentation of your capabilities that you should support and actively promote.\n",
    "- First, you should `consider outsourcing certain projects to competent, capable, and proven third parties` (with a long track record of success). The projects to be considered are those that others in your industry have completed and are now considered tables stakes to be competitive at the new level of efficiency and effectiveness that the industry operates at or that the market, customers, suppliers, and patients demand. You need competent team members to manage the project, but you do not need analytical professionals to manage this relationship and process. The project will need oversight and analytical validation, which you and your team will need to provide, but daily supervision is not required.\n",
    "- Second, you should `support the operational areas that want to invest in business intelligence, descriptive statistics, and smallscale predictive analytics`. Your team cannot do it all, but your team can help these functional areas hire the right staff members, undertake initial projects, and consult on predictive and prescriptive applications in the future. Helping the organization build a broader and deeper capability is part of your responsibility and it will build a network of supportive team members who aspire to grow in their skills and abilities and may be good candidates to join the COE in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact on Jobs\n",
    "`AI will have an effect on jobs` - it will actually, in all likelihood, create more jobs than it eliminates, but we need to be aware that these new jobs will be different and require higher-level skills than the jobs that are replaced. AI will augment and extend existing jobs. The idea that AI will eliminate jobs is overblown; in most cases, AI will remove the mundane aspects of work and allow people to focus on elements of work that call on more creative and subjective skills. Jobs have been evolving since the creation of work. AI is just another factor in that continuing evolution. AI is different and it has the potential to drive wide-ranging changes, but it is just another factor in the evolution of work."

    "## High-performing Advanced Analytics and AI team - Definition\n",
    "When these foundational team dynamics are in place and improving over time, you have achieved the establishment of a **high-functioning advanced analytics capability** for your team and organization:\n",
    "- The team is staffed with the `highest-caliber team members that you can attract, afford, and retain`. The team is `cohesive and collaborative` and willing to review the projects of each other and sub-teams. The team members are `willing to work together` for the greater good of the whole team.\n",
    "- The advanced analytics and AI team members connect professionally with executive and senior managers across the entire company. When the analytics team interacts with senior managers and executives, the `staff members outside the advanced analytics team have a positive and assured reaction to the team members`. The advanced analytics team members work in a collaborative manner with the subject matter experts and each group respects the other and builds trust across the teams.\n",
    "- The advanced analytics team presents initial results with confidence and receives feedback and input from internal and external parties to improve data quality, model results, and the fit of the applications built for use by end users and business analysts and other data scientists outside the advanced analytics and AI team. Projects are scoped, described, undertaken, and completed and the groups move on to execute subsequent projects with `enthusiasm and engagement`. "

    "## Analytics Leader\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leadership** is a well-worn term used in a highly varied and diverse set of contexts. Here the term is used to describe and discuss the `people who attract, evaluate, hire, manage, fire, lead, and otherwise direct and encourage all the aspects of the daily operation of an advanced analytics and AI team`. **Leadership** is a role that `encompasses daily managerial duties, extends through the annual business cycle, and touches and influences the strategic direction of the business`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exemplary leadership of an analytics team is a uniquely multifaceted role**. To be a good - and possibly great - leader of analytics teams and of peers and superiors, **an analytics leader**: \n",
    "- `Needs to have a mastery of analytical techniques`. Without this foundational knowledge, the leader will not gain or maintain the respect of the more technical analytics team members. \n",
    "- `Possess business expertise, knowledge, and acumen`. Without this, the leader will not be able to illustrate and demonstrate a vision of why analytics can and will be valuable to their functional peers and superiors. \n",
    "- `Needs to understand and be able to communicate the best path forward, melding the requirements of data, analytical techniques, and technology with business operations and market` needs to deliver practical, pragmatic operational improvements in daily operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Leadership in analytics** requires the person assuming the role to have the `ability to understand, synthesize, and communicate the value` of all these respective streams of work to a wide range of people in the analytics team, across the organization, and outside the organization with vendors, partners, and possible collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The people in the **leadership positions**:\n",
    "- `Undertake activities related to defining the vision, direction, application, implementation, maintenance, revision, and continuation of analytics programs and projects`. \n",
    "- `Ensure the ongoing relevance of advanced analytics` to examine, develop, predict, prescribe, and affect change in their immediate organization or department, functional group or division, and the entire organization and the organizations that are related to and interact with their companies. \n",
    "- `Are involved in developing and exerting a positive influence` on their advanced analytics teams, other operational and functional teams, the management of those teams, the peers of the leaders we are discussing, and the senior and executive management teams who are responsible for the strategic vision and daily operation of the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traits of Successful Analytics Leaders\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Consistency is an element of work or an approach to interacting with a wide range of people that is most valued and respected. Being consistent is reassuring to people, whether those people work for you, or you work for them, or whether you are collaborating across functions, across organizations, or across continents. Being a consistent force and applying your core principles in a consistent manner enables people to trust you. Consistency can be the foundation that enables people to build multi-dimensional relationships that can last for years, and possibly a lifetime. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Consistency** is an outward `manifestation of being honest, ethical, and having core principles that guide your actions`. Being transparent and honest changes the way you act and shows up in your personal and professional relationships. Consistency is a trait that you should strive to cultivate and one that you should seek in people you work and collaborate with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Passion:** Be passionate, yet even-tempered. Be interested and passioned for data, analysis, and advanced analytics. In a professional setting or context, situations and challenges are typically complex, with numerous groups and individuals being involved. Each group and subset of individuals will be working to advance their agenda and interests; this is natural and to be expected. A helpful assumption to begin with is that `a complete understanding of each party, their agenda, and motivations is useful and needed to develop a full picture of the project, program, or situation`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    `Try to go into each discussion with an open mind and ask as many questions as possible to gain a clearer view of the relative positions of each participant in the dialog. Remain detached and centered as you gather the required information. Once you have developed an entire, or nearly complete, understanding then you can engage fully to help mold the solution by employing your knowledge, experience, and passion.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Curiosity:** `Good leaders are curious`. Curious about their staff, the organization they work in, the improvements they and the advanced analytics team are endeavoring to bring into reality, the people they meet, the people they are collaborating with, and all aspects of their work situations that have an impact on the project they and their team are engaged in. \n",
    "\n",
    "    There is no more intoxicating drug for people than asking them questions about themselves. It is scientifically proven that the brain releases more dopamine when people talk about topics that they care about, and no one cares more for any other topic than the topic of themselves. If you can flip the script and ask more questions, people will think you are more interesting, and you will learn about yourself in ways you cannot imagine. `Stop talking about yourself and ask questions`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Leaders need to be curious. `Leaders cannot know everything that there is to know`. Knowledge is like a map. The vast majority of people believe that maps are static and unchanging. That is not true. Maps are updated constantly. Some more than others, but all maps vary over time and so does knowledge. Knowledge is based on facts and reality and those underlying elements evolve to fit the current circumstances.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Ownership:** You need to know that your every act and action has an impact and redirects the situation in a positive or negative way. `If and when you find yourself talking about how the main factors contributing to a current, typically negative, outcome are outside your control, stop and think about how you contributed to the current environment`. Taking stock of your impact is crucial to being a good leader and being able to improve and redirect nearly all outcomes. `Taking the position of a passive participant, or even worse, a victim of circumstances, is not how you want to act or be perceived as acting`. Show up and be proactive, engaged, and an empathetic part of the solution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Variety:** One of the great joys of a career in analytics is the `variety of subject areas that you are invited to discuss, examine, reinvent, and possibly improve`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholder Engagement Process\n",
    "It is in your interest, as an analytics leader, to begin early in the analytics process and project to understand the needs of the functional managers in completing the organizational change element of the adoption process. You need to engage with the executives, the sponsors, and the subject matter experts to determine their motivations in being involved in the project and process. The shared or individual motivations will lead and guide how you and the functional manager's plan for the `organizational change management process`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary role and that of your analytics team is to engage with stakeholders, including executives, sponsors, peers, and subject matter experts, to:\n",
    "- understand their challenges and problems; \n",
    "- translate those challenges into analytical applications and models; \n",
    "- build those applications and models; \n",
    "- prove that the new data-driven approach delivers superior operational results on a reliable and repeatable basis when compared to the previous approach; \n",
    "- convince the executives, sponsors, and subject matter experts to adopt the innovations and changes; \n",
    "- document and communicate success to sponsors and executives; \n",
    "- maintain funding and support for you, your team, and the infrastructure needed to execute on your mission;\n",
    "- and then to do it again and again, on repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the leader of this new team, it is important that you `connect with sponsors (executives), stakeholders (management), and subject matter experts (functional staff) and have a positive, collaborative, and cooperative relationship with all those groups`. It is crucial to your success and that of your new team that the executives and their downline organizations embrace analytics and engage in the process of building analytical applications that will be the leading edge of change and transformation in processes, people, products, and more. Your personal success and that of the analytics team lies partly in your ability to connect and effectively partner with a wide range of people in the organization. The skills you possess, employ, and deploy in the area of emotional intelligence are paramount in this aspect of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a global organization, if you have a global role, `you will need to meet with a substantial number of people`, and depending on the culture of the organization, you may need to meet with those people either in one-on-one settings, small departmental groups, or in large auditorium/stadium settings, or perhaps in all of those settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Word-of-mouth networking` by those that have collaborated with you and your team is crucial for sustained success. The people that your team has helped reach and exceed their goals will talk about your team, the projects, and the value that has been delivered. The stories being conveyed at sales meetings, functional gatherings, in the cafeteria, and in formal presentations will make or break the ability of your team to expand its connections and influence internally. Word-of-mouth - internal and external - marketing, can be thought of as a flywheel effect. Once momentum is achieved, it becomes self-sustaining. Executives and senior managers will tell their staff to seek you and your group out to solve a wide range of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Plans and Proposals\n",
    "The role of the analytics leader and team is to `develop, present, and clarify detailed project plans and proposals` that can be easily and fairly compared with competing projects, and it is the duty of the **project review board or executives or other managers** to provide sufficient review, governance, and guidance to all project managers on why projects are being selected and undertaken and why others are being deferred or rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytics leadership needs to set the expectations with the functional team and leadership about timing, the type of results they can expect, and if this is a project that will produce a singular outcome to derive insights or a set of models that will require implementation by inserting those models into existing processes. One-time insights are easy to understand and work with. Production-based models require processes, workflows, and procedural changes, which may be harder to understand and take more time to plan for and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change Management\n",
    "As an analytics leader, change management, employee upskilling, and reskilling are probably not in your wheelhouse and probably were not in your consideration set, but those elements of organizational change management are gating and mitigating factors that will dampen your success and your ability to succeed. `The analytics team will not lead and manage the change management process`. There are other organizations, such as project management or human resources, who are skilled and adept at managing the change management process. You and the functional team leader need to bring these supporting organizational entities into the process to help plan for and execute the change management process in relation to the employees, training, process modeling, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication\n",
    "Your role in `communicating clearly and in a concise manner` comes down to being able to describe, discuss, and sell a vision for an analytical process (i.e. a complete transformation of the supply chain), while breaking the time line, resources required, investment needed, and relative probability of success into manageable projects (i.e. improving first-time, on-time, and in-full orders) so that the executives, sponsors, subject matter experts, finance professionals, portfolio management professionals, and all related and involved parties can understand, evaluate, and support the analytics team and projects proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communicate the case for implementing and adopting new applications based on simple metrics and language that mirrors the objectives and goals of the functional team, using the metrics that the functional teams use to measure and illustrate success, such as time saved, the ability to redeploy and upskill the team into new and more valuable roles, money saved, new hires deferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "`The way you, as the analytics leader, show up in the company and in each meeting determines who will engage with you and your team`. The impressions you make determines how successful the team and you will be because it determines the people who will engage with you and your team and the level of funding, effort, and resources they will dedicate to the projects that you and they jointly undertake. `Every meeting is a chance for you to show up and put your best self forward. Don't squander that opportunity. Not everyone gets the chance to make a difference`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a Supportive and Engaged Team\n",
    "Another part of your role as the leader of the analytics function is to `ensure that the advanced analytics team is engaged and enjoying their work`. One way that I have been able to ensure that the team is growing and learning and yet staying on track to deliver relevant, successful, and impactful results is to look to large digital-native companies like Instagram, Facebook, Google, and others to see what techniques and tools they are employing to solve technical, data, and business problems. `Techniques and technologies from other applications and industries are valuable and useful:` using them is a good idea, and you are encouraged to bring in innovations to drive operational results, but always keep in mind that the analytics work being undertaken needs to lead to real results and operational improvement. Leveraging proven innovations from other industries and firms increases the knowledge base of the analytics team, reduces the chance of project failure, and raises the profile of your analytics projects in the minds of the executives, sponsors, and subject matter experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the current technical, professional, and soft skills of the team and the teams that are ancillary to the core analytics team**. Traditionally, analytics teams were comprised of a significant number of highly autonomous individual contributors, and to some extent, for many teams, there remains a bias in this area. This is a problem. Especially now that we are welcoming in new employees and retaining valuable employees, and this staff mix can span four generations. This mix of employees needs to collaborate effectively and share knowledge that spans the domains of technology, projects, communication protocols, organizational and historical awareness, operations and data, and other tangible and intangible topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foster a respectful, open environment where all personnel feel comfortable in expressing their ideas and approaches to difficult technical, process, and  organizational challenges**. As new people join the group, they need a chance and an open and welcoming forum to acclimate and join the team; not to just physically join the team, but also socially and sychologically. The first few months of any new person's tenure are critical to them feeling like they belong. As a leader, you need to spend time ensuring that this process is being actively attended to for each new employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensure that you have taken the time, and made time for the group**, to spend time together before the harried pace of projects becomes too intense; to have each of the team members share their personal experiences, professional accomplishments, areas of expertise, experience, current areas of study, and more. You need to give the team time to get to know each other as people and as professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensure you are not the smartest person in the room**. If you are, then you are either an incredible person, or you have hired poorly, or maybe a bit of both. `Competing with your team to be crowned the best and brightest is one of the fastest paths to team discord and employee turnover`. If you are lucky, you will have a team of highly skilled, highly trained professionals who have technical acumen in varied areas that include math, technology, data management, process design, user interaction design, and more. For your success and your team's well-being, you need to celebrate their expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term and Long-term Strategy\n",
    "- **Open a channel for every user in the organization to propose ideas for data and analytics**. The ideas, the networking, the new global perspective, and the interesting projects are all reasons why you need to open the flood gates to each and every end user in the organization. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The guidance to end users (executives, senior managers, functional managers, subject matter experts, and casual users) is this: if you have an idea for how data and analytics can help you and your team, call me or e-mail me immediately. Don't design the solution, don't agonize about the profusion of data or the lack of data, don't think about the budget implications or how long it might take to build the analytical application – just call me or e-mail me as soon as you have an idea that you want to discuss.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Balance between ad-hoc requests and projects**. As you and your team focus on your objectives and goals, you need to know how to take a bit of your time to help ensure that the analytics team assists colleagues in the operational and functional areas to meet their goals and objectives so you and the analytics team can meet your goals and objectives and continue on the mission of improving the organization through the use of data and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remember, you are the expert and they are the novices**. `It is your role and responsibility to teach them and communicate with them and convince them that they should come on this journey with you and your team`. At first, this may seem to be a waste of your time, but it is not. You need them and they need you, even if they do not know it yet. Be patient and describe the challenge, solution, and benefit in as many ways as required for them to buy in and join the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analytics is a long-term commitment**. Having a focus on data and analytics needs to become like sales or manufacturing. You would never hear a corporate executive say we are going to de-emphasize sales for a year, or we will deprioritize manufacturing for the next two quarters. `The analytics process only works if there is support from executives and management to fund the resources and ongoing support for the efforts and programs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define interfaces between the analytics team and their stakeholders**, agree on formats, processes, RACIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automate everything**.\n",
    "    - Build the data management automation as part of the project. Build it, refine it, and revise it in each of the process steps of the analytics process. You, the analytics team, the functional team, the sponsors, subject matter experts, and others will probably not notice that you and your team executed the work in this manner, but they will notice it if you don't.\n",
    "    - Build the data management automation that provides for the routine execution of the models and applications (Analytics Environment, ML Pipelines, MLOps). It does not take long for every data scientist to become a data management operator with no time to undertake new projects. `Automating data management tasks is the only way to keep the data science team from becoming data management operations staff`.\n",

    "### Ethics & Culture\n",
    "Use data and analytics for ethical, honest, and transparent purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Data and Analytics Literacy\n",
    "Managers (and otehr stakeholders) for the most part have a difficult time understanding analytics. It is a fact; most SMEs, managers and executives are not literate when it comes to data and analytics. You cannot and should not assume that they understand even the basics of what you are proposing to do; even if they say that they understand, it is more than likely that they do not. `Keep meeting and communicating` with them and explaining the scope, scale, purpose, investment, and outcomes expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process and Product Ownership (From Analytics to Production)\n",
    "Analytics leadership needs to make it clear to the functional team and leadership that **the analytics team** will take responsibility for the analytics process of building the initial analytical applications and models, and the analytics team will own and be responsible for refreshing the models within the analytical applications, but that **the functional teams** need to run and own the analytical applications when they are operating as an integral part of the production processes. One common variation of this process is that the analytics team may need to turn the analytical application over to **the Information Technology (IT) team** rather than the functional team. The information technology team may host the analytical application in an environment that the IT team controls. The IT team may subject the analytical application, and any subsequent changes to the application and the models within the application, to change control processes operated by the information management team. Ultimately, the IT team may provide access to the analytical application to the functional users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this such an important topic? Because if you, as the analytics leader, are not looking out into the future and ensuring that the end users in the functional departments and the staff of the IT department are ready to undertake the daily running of the analytical applications, the productivity of the analytics team will plummet as you and your team spend more and more time running the analytical applications that you have built rather than working on new solutions. Just as you do not want your team operating the applications and models that the team has built, you do not want to be caught off guard by not planning for the work that is required to update each and every model that is built and moved into production. `The updating of each individual model and the entire library of models needs to be planned for and scheduled as part of the routine operation of the analytics function`. Define how models are managed and refreshed proactively on a regular, repeatable, and well-understood cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Truths\n",
    "- **People do not change in the time required**: People can change, but usually the window for change at a deep personal level, which is what is needed to affect the personality traits that are problematic, is measured in decades. People do change, but over the arc of a lifetime; not in the time needed to be successful in their current role. People will modify their actions and behavior in the interest of self-preservation or self-interest, but they will always revert to their core nature.\n",
    "- **Cultural change**: Organizations are comprised of people. Therefore, organizational change is gated by the amount of change individuals can understand and assimilate. `Culture is slow to change`. Culture can and will change, but those that are brought into drive or affect change will be rejected and fail if they press too hard, too soon. In the metaphor of change, you want to be the river, not the rock.\n",
    "- **Don't hang on, move on**: If you don't like your job, move on. Don't hang on, move on. If you are unhappy with the job that you have, find a new one in the organization or move to a new organization. If there are people on your staff who are continually unhappy, help them move on. Be brave. Find a job that you would enjoy - those jobs are out there."

    "## Analytics Team\n",
    "**Analytics teams**, and those individuals that comprise those teams - the highly talented and skilled people involved in scoping, designing, building, testing, implementing, deploying, and in some cases, maintaining advanced analytics applications, systems, and environments - are unique. Managing a high-performing analytics team is a unique endeavor. Such teams need solid guidance, but, in general, `do not react well to micromanagement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Management by a non-practitioner or novice typically ends in failure`. Managing a team that is building advanced analytics environments is not the same as managing a typical information technology project. Many firms fail in the organizational design phase of building an analytics team. Organizations and managers often fail to realize that **managing a group of analytics professionals is more similar to managing a group of creative professionals than it is to managing a group of programmers**. When leaders and managers allow this kind of rudderless environment to be built or to develop, data scientists resign and move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most people think that analytics work is the straightforward application of math to data, it is not that simple. You and your team do need data, and need to have a mastery of analytical techniques, but `analytics projects have more of a creative element` than most people realize. Many of the most talented analytics professionals works with possess a unique combination of linear, analytical, left-brain thinking, but also a non-linear, right-brained, creative element to their genius. This fact is part of the reason why `managing an analytics team is not the same as managing a technology team`. **There is a need for data exploration, hypothesizing, testing, and interrogation of ideas, concepts, dead ends, and surprising discoveries**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced analytics and AI team members you are seeking are more than experts in advanced analytics; you are seeking staff members who are agents of change and can act as guides to the broader organization about how to undertake changes at a scale and scope that the organization can understand and undertake without experiencing traumatic disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Your team needs staff members who have both experience and expertise, but you also need bright, young sparks` who do not know what has been done before, and therefore, do not place limitations on their thinking and approaches to challenges that most experienced staff members would consider impossible to solve. Young, talented staff members view challenges from new and varied perspectives. They use new thinking, new technologies, and see prospective solutions in new and unique ways. Unleash their creative and innovative spirits and you will see solutions that you had not dreamed of before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The advanced analytics team is responsible and accountable for delivering analytics that drive operational improvement, but they cannot do it alone**. Once they deliver projects that make an impact, the broader organization needs to talk about those successes; subject matter experts from all functional areas need to engage with the advanced analytics and AI team, fund the analytics team and hold those results up and demand more of the same from the analytics team and the broader organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytics team roles:\n",
    "- **Core Team** (artisanal or factory analytics team, analytics - data scientists, AI/ML engineers - ML Pipelines, MLOps)\n",
    "- **Data Engineering** (data foundation and processing automation)\n",
    "- **DevOps** (automated analytical environment)\n",
    "- **Product Owner** (functional partner)\n",
    "- **Scrum Master** (analytical process facilitator)\n",
    "- **Project management** (can be outside of the analytics team)\n",
    "    - Data product operationalization\n",
    "    - Organizational change management (data product is not enough, the change/improvement in product/process must be properly managed)\n",
    "    \n",
    "For the most part, `individuals who are adept at building analytical environments possess or exhibit the following characteristics`:\n",
    "- Optimistic yet skeptical\n",
    "- Intensely curious\n",
    "- Mostly introverted\n",
    "- Logical\n",
    "- A combination of left and right brain orientation at the same time\n",
    "- Intelligent\n",
    "- Self-critical\n",
    "- Prone to perfection\n",
    "- Social, but reserved\n",
    "- In some cases, they appear to exhibit a lack of focus or possibly too much focus\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Structure Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artisanal**: Data scientists who can execute this model successfully `are the most skilled data scientists that you can find and hire`. Data scientists capable of executing and managing the artisanal approach:\n",
    "    - possess exemplary communication skills, \n",
    "    - are open to listening to a wide range of stakeholders, \n",
    "    - can work with internal and external parties, \n",
    "    - are knowledgeable about a wide range of analytical techniques, \n",
    "    - are probably experts in one or two analytical approaches, \n",
    "    - have the ability to understand the immediate next steps as well as the long-term project goals and objectives, \n",
    "    - and can translate the technical objectives of the project into business goals and financial returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factory**: In the Factory model, the work process is broken down into single-focus, repeatable steps, and the process is staffed with people appropriate to execute those steps as part of the larger data science process. The Factory process relies on a larger number of people who are executing smaller, specialized steps in the overall process. You may structure the team in several ways. One possibility would be to structure the work process in the following manner:\n",
    "    - Data acquisition\n",
    "    - Data cleaning and integration\n",
    "    - Feature engineering\n",
    "    - Model building\n",
    "    - Model validation\n",
    "    - Project management\n",
    "    - Stakeholder (sponsor and subject matter expert) management\n",
    "    - Project-to-production management\n",
    "    - Ongoing model and application upgrades and maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybrid**: With a Hybrid model, you can achieve the creation and deployment of innovative intellectual property that can change the competitive profile of the company and you can build applications that keep your firm at the leading edge of operational effectiveness and efficiency. The **Artisanal group** can drive innovation, and change, through the deployment of highly valued patentable applications that put and keep the firm on the leading edge of any industry. The **Factory group** can build, deploy, and maintain analytical applications that achieve and maintain operational efficiency across global operations at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "`A good method might be to start with an `**Artisanal team**` and evolve toward a `**Hybrid model**. Starting with the **Artisanal model**` has a number of benefits` to you, the analytics team, and the company as a whole. \n",
    "- The first benefit is that starting with an Artisanal team enables you and the analytics team to connect with C-Level and senior executives on mission-critical problems. \n",
    "- The second benefit is that you and the analytics team can act like a SWAT team, moving quickly to understand the problem, moving through modeling the problem, and offering solutions and insights in a matter of weeks or days rather than months or years. \n",
    "\n",
    "The early success can be followed up by taking on larger, more complex problems, which will require a larger team, which marks the start of the evolution toward the Hybrid model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytics vs. IT Team\n",
    "The great majority of non-technical people, including corporate executives, think and believe that a technical resource is the same regardless of whether they are developing transactional systems, business intelligence, dashboards, or artificial intelligence applications. `Executives, across a wide range of industries, tend to think and act as if any technical resource is interchangeable with any other`. And part of this problem stems from the fact that they see technical people as resources. They do not understand, and for the most part, do not try to understand, the nuances of the various differences between the skillsets, motivations, and intrinsic interests of individuals who possess technical talent. `This mindset and view is patently false, and it is one that causes companies around the world to waste millions, if not billions, of dollars each year`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A partial cause of this situation is that the technology function is a relatively new addition to the corporate structure. Think of accounting, manufacturing, sales, and distribution. No competent executive would say that we can take a top performing sales professional and put them in accounting. It sounds ludicrous to even say it. But, given that the technology function has been part of the corporate environment for less than 80 years, we hear nonsensical statements like, \"We can take the developers who created the CRM system and have them build the artificial intelligence system for predictive maintenance.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "`Advanced analytics projects are not the same as information technology (IT) projects`. Installing an instance of Salesforce is relatively easy and a well-known and generally linear process. Also, information technology professionals typically do not have the skillset to develop artificial intelligence applications. Staff members in information technology functions have evolved over the past 30 to 40 years, from developing bespoke systems to installing systems, managing customizations, and configurations. `Information technology professionals are more oriented to vendor and project management than they are to core development`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Advanced analytics projects` are not, for the most part, linear. They `are iterative`, marked by exhilarating successes, and punctuated by dead ends, missteps, and disproved theories. Most information technology professionals, while intelligent and mildly curious, do not have the interest or fortitude for the iterative or recursive nature of advanced analytics projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The information technology function is a support function - a cost center, not a creative function** - that lives by project plans and has a reticence or visceral fear of failure or being late or over budget. Information technology teams have been treated like a support function for the last 30 to 40 years, and the teams that work in the information technology department act accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced analytics teams, at least high-performing analytics teams, are seeking to solve one or a series of challenging problems. They are innovating**. The pursuit of the solution is the goal, not adherence to a budget number or delivery according to a preset date. `The optimal solution, the source of competitive advantage, is the objective`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A high functioning analytics team acts more like a management consulting group or an internal consultancy than a functional team**. While the advanced analytics and AI team utilizes data and technology to accomplish its goals and objectives, `the analytics team is not a technology team`. The functional teams may perceive the advanced analytics and AI team as an extension of the information technology team and that is a limiting view and a source of future problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Placement of the Advanced Analytics Function in the Organization Structure\n",
    "One of the primary considerations to keep in mind is that the context in which the advanced analytics and AI team operates is different than operational teams. Operational and functional teams, like finance and manufacturing, work in their defined domains and rarely deviate from their cyclical processes. Analytics teams work across the entire organization, interfacing with all levels of the company with a focus on discovery, disruption, creativity, and innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most successful advanced analytics teams are creative groups staffed with talented, motivated, curious people who can convert business discussions with subject matter experts into analytical applications and solutions that can drive operational change on a daily basis. The analytical teams that realize the most success have wide-ranging mandates to drive practical and pragmatic change resulting in competitive advantage. `The best organizational home for the advanced analytics team is reporting directly to either the `**Chief Operating Officer (COO)**` or the `**Chief Executive Officer (CEO)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a COO exists, it would be rare to see this group under the CEO, unless the CEO is younger, ambitious, and engaged. Recently, there have been a handful of **Chief Analytics Officer (CAO)** appointments reporting to the CEO. This is typically a move to illustrate where the CEO wants to place emphasis. It will be interesting to see how long this type of reporting relationship remains in place, before evolving into a new form and structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Working directly for the CEO can work, and it is one of the optimal reporting structures for the CAO and the advanced analytics teams, but it is often difficult to gain time with the CEO to ensure alignment and focus. To be clear, `reporting to the CEO is the best direct reporting relationship the CAO can, and would, want to have`, and if the CEO prioritizes the relationship with the CAO and publicly funds and supports the mission of the advanced analytics team, then this is the best possible organizational structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Having the CAO report to the COO is the next best reporting structure to have in place`. The **COO** has the corporate functions under their control, and can direct the functions to collaborate with the CAO and the advanced analytics team to examine processes, data, and more to drive innovation and change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuing down the senior management structure, `the third best place for the CAO to report is to the `**Executive Vice President of Business Development and Strategy**. This role typically owns mergers and acquisitions, strategy, and corporate development. Therefore, the mission to drive innovation typically resides in this group. `Given the amount of change that the CAO and the advanced analytics team will drive, they need to be reporting to a corporate change agent with the organizational power to direct the functional groups to engage and collaborate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outsourcing\n",
    "When you are asked to outsource a portion of the analytics process, you need to know what you can easily outsource without compromising quality. In most cases, you can outsource portions of the analytical process. Let's break it down for clarity:\n",
    "- **Easy to outsource:** You can outsource the following activities with the lowest risk: data acquisition, data integration, data profiling, data loading, and data visualization steps are the easiest to outsource and can lower the overall cost of operations.\n",
    "- **More difficult to outsource and success is difficult to achieve:** Feature engineering can be executed by an outside vendor if the company you are outsourcing to has not only technical skills, but also skills in the business or functional domain related to the analytical models to be produced, but this combination of skills is hard to find in a service provider.\n",
    "- **Hard to outsource and hard to achieve repeatable success:** This is the modeling phase. I have had very little success and have seen even less success when other companies attempt to outsource the model building function. Numerous firms present and represent that they can build models and I am sure that they can build models, but the question is, are they effective models, are the models easy to update, and do they contain a solid foundation that can be extended to include a broader operational domain as you learn more and more about the data, operations, and strategic direction planned by the executive team? This can work if the domain you are focused on is one that is generic, well known, and widely applicable. The need to build an analytical or predictive system in this instance is probably driven by the need that all other relevant competitors have this type of system and the company needs to implement the system to simply remain  competitive. In those cases, outsourcing may work.\n",
    "- **Nearly impossible to outsource:** The integration of predictive models into production processes is so unique and individualistic that outsourcing nearly always fails or is more expensive and time-consuming than staffing and undertaking the effort internally. I suppose that if a vendor is running the production process in a cloud environment that is outsourced to the external vendor and the vendor is an expert in managing and extending the process, this is possible, but that is a very specialized case. I have not seen success in outsourcing the modification of  proprietary processes that are managing a factory or a supply chain or an operating room. \n",
    "    Typically, the modification and changing of these processes are quite unique and require the expertise of multiple groups within an organization. Also falling into this category is model management. It takes significant skill and expertise to know when to change models and it takes even more skill and knowledge to know which model is the best to move into production next. Outsourcing these tasks are done at your peril.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Another way to make this point is to `think of it in terms of the core versus context framework`. \n",
    "- **Areas that deliver competitive differentiation for a specific company would not work well for an outsourcer** as these are core business factors. Core business processes are typically unique and are not able to be generalized across many organizations. \n",
    "- Rather, **areas aligned with a common commodity function or context are opportunities for working with an outsourced partner**. Corporate functions (for example, HR and Legal) and analytics related to those functions are good places to look for this type of partnership. Unless you're doing something really special with those functions, pushing them out to a group who can do it cheaper would free up resources for focusing on core functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Work Dynamics\n",
    "`Talented and skilled individuals are better at collaboration`. In general, they have a more evolved world view or mature understanding of human nature. They are less possessive of the ideas that they may have generated or those that they may have borrowed in the process of understanding and solving multi-step, interconnected, and interrelated challenges. This is important for several reasons:\n",
    "- `Most challenges that are appropriate for the advanced analytics and AI team to solve are mission-critical, difficult, and wide-ranging, thereby requiring more than one person to develop solutions to them`. There is a subset of the overall population of people that you could hire who are very good at the technical aspects of the role and may have been incredible individual contributors but who are ill-equipped to collaborate. These possible staff members might be good junior data scientists, but they will not be successful as senior staff members unless they can grow their ability to be part of a larger effort. You may even choose to hire them, but they need to understand the team model, structure, their current and expected role, and the skills that they need to develop and master before they can become senior members of the analytics team.\n",
    "- `The best solutions are designed and developed in an iterative manner where the sub-team presents their initial and interim findings and work products to the larger analytics team for evaluation, discussion, and iteration`. If the team member cannot present their work products in a cogent manner, the broader team cannot help in improving the project. If the team member's ego will not allow them to hear and receive feedback, the impact will be felt beyond the project and will impact the team dynamic and the work environment. In some cases, you and other analytical team members will attribute this inability to the presentation and communication skills of the employee, and in some cases that may be the reason for their lack of sharing, but you need to delve more deeply into the root cause of the lack of sharing. In a few cases, you will find that the lack of sharing is due to feelings of paranoia or superiority. Both root causes need to be discerned in the interview process and if people possess these views, you are best served by not bringing these individuals on to your team. The root causes of these behaviors are beyond the ability of most managers to lessen or eliminate.\n",
    "- `The analytics team needs to present their iterative work to the sponsors and subject matter experts for review and revision`. They need to engender confidence and engagement from the functional team that has entrusted the analytics team to build a solution to the challenge that the functional team is facing. The sub-team leadership needs to be open to the input of the business team, but also needs to be cognizant of keeping the project on track and remain true to the charter that has been agreed to. If the project sub-team is not open to the ideas of the business, the collaboration and the quality of the project will suffer and, even worse, future collaborations and projects may never come to fruition because the business team will experience the lack of openness and receptivity of the sub-team leader or the entire sub-team.\n",
    "- `No one person can know the entirety of the knowledge base in the wide-ranging and interconnected fields of study that are required to build the optimal and complete solution to any of the challenges presented by the functional areas of any business`. It is impossible for an analytics professional to be knowledgeable about all of the changes and innovations in the technical and functional areas of the multiple fields that they may work in on the many projects that they will undertake. A key takeaway is that no one can be everything in a project, team, or sub-team. Collaboration and communication skills are key to the initial, immediate, and long-term success of the analytics team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hiring Talents\n",
    "Talented people can be humble and possess humility and they can also be insufferable jerks. `Jerks are not worth the effort`. The best approach to the self-absorbed and self-important is to not hire them; to screen them out and never bring them into your organization. How do you screen them out? First and foremost, `make it clear to everyone in the interviewing process that company and team cultural fit is one of the most important aspects of the hiring process`. Of course, you want to hire the best talent available, but cultural fit is key and overrides any measure of technical skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "`In the hiring process, have a wide range of people interview the candidates`; not only you and your advanced analytics and AI team, but staff from Human Resources, and members of one of the operational areas that you have collaborated with and have been successful in developing and deploying an analytical application. The more people that you can have interact with the candidate the better. The advanced analytics team can vet the candidate from a data science and technology view, but your stakeholders and Human Resources will give you a better read on the fit of the candidate for your team and the company overall. Listen to external opinions on the questions of cultural, team, and company fit; they hire more people on a regular and on-going basis than you and your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "When inheriting someone who is just not going to work in the new environment, it is best to determine where they would be a good fit. You will need to assess their strengths and weaknesses. If those can be determined, you can encourage and openly support their move to a new area of the business. If they are just a problem, then it is unethical to try to move them to another area of the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Those that want to succeed and grow in this market need to be operating at the highest level of their abilities on both sides of the equation – technical and soft skills`. The bar has been raised, and to be a top performer, you need to meet or exceed those expectations. The most talented analytics professionals are keen, unique, and in some cases, unusual observers of life, processes, people, and the world in general. They look beyond the surface of a process, result, or model. They look at the precursors. They look at the economic and organizational context of the phenomena to be dissected. They look for elemental causes and effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the talents and traits that you want in your advanced analytics team members is creativity in thinking about data and the wide range of internal and external data sources that you can access, integrate, and use. If your team does not `have at least one person who is passionate and curious about how to leverage data`, your team will unlikely be able to reach their potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internship\n",
    "`Internships and co-ops are a great way to bring new talent into your organization`. If you can initiate, develop, and scale this type of program, you can hire the majority of your new staff members through this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to gaining access to young, intelligent, and prescreened talent is to work with select undergraduate and graduatelevel universities to hire undergraduate and graduate-level students on internships and co-op programs. This approach enables the students to work on varied and challenging real-world problems and situations, and you and your team have an opportunity to \"interview\" these prospective employees over multiple months. You must be ready for you and your team members to mentor and manage the young team members. You must also be ready for projects to fail, but to learn from those failures, and you must be ready for projects to succeed and that those successes will demand and require that company to change to take advantage of new innovations, insights, and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consideration is that younger staff members will have less experience in certain areas such as written and verbal communication skills and stakeholder management. If your efforts to drive innovation are to reap the maximum benefit, you will be putting these young, untested interns in collaboration with subject matter experts and business sponsors in functional areas of the company. The combination of the intern's technical expertise and enthusiasm coupled with the deep functional knowledge of the subject matter experts is a potent and desirable combination that can, and will, lead to breakthrough developments, but you will need to teach the young staff members how to interface with the more senior functional staff members in a manner that is appropriate for the project and overall business environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diversity, Inclusion and Culture\n",
    "Advanced analytics and AI teams are made up of a wide range of personalities, from the introverted to the highly extroverted, from the careful and thoughtful to the impulsive and innovative. Analytics teams benefit greatly from the varied perspectives that a wide spectrum of individuals bring to the collaborative environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "One area of diversity that is not typically discussed because it is unique to advanced analytics and AI teams is the diversity of knowledge in analytical approaches. `The team is better served from having individuals who are experts, but experts in various analytical approaches`. The team needs experts in natural language processing for text-based applications, neural networks for image processing, deep learning for a wide range of predictive applications, decision trees for problems with a large number of relevant variables to be considered, and emerging fields like video and audio processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experts will mentor the other team members in learning the technologies, techniques, and other considerations of building solutions for the class of problem being addressed. The experts act as teachers and mentors for the other team members to become proficient, if not experts, in the technique being used for the immediate project, and on the next project, a different expert provides the same opportunity for the other team members to learn from them and broaden their technical portfolio of skills. This dynamic is important for the analytics team to grow in their collaboration skills as a team and for individuals to grow in technical proficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, all team members need to be experts in basic mathematics, and it is useful and helpful if they are well educated and competent in basic and advanced statistics and probability theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced analytics and AI team needs to have a foundational operating premise that they are all valued and respected members of the team and that they all have valid views that can be freely expressed in a positive manner to improve any project that they are involved in or to review a colleague or sub-team (**team culture**). It is expected that everyone respects all other team members personally and professionally and that our differences are a source of strength that provides our team with a broader and deeper view than any other team in the organization or that of our partner organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disciplinary action\n",
    "There are aspects of human behavior that cannot be tolerated, and need to be avoided, or reacted to when they occur. If these aspects cannot be avoided or managed in a professional manner, action must be taken to protect the overall staff and the organization. People who exhibit aggressive behavior, those who are not respectful of others, those who will not listen and collaborate to build upon the offerings and ideas of others, and those that cannot perform their duties even when accommodations have been made and consideration given to their needs must be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Delaying disciplinary action is always an error in judgment`. If you feel the need to take disciplinary action in relation to an employee, then you should contact the Human Resources department immediately and move forward. By delaying action, you are putting yourself in jeopardy. Always act in a collaborative manner with the aligned functional groups in the organization, but never delay, when deciding on how to proceed with disciplinary action.\n",

    "Ensuring that subject matter experts, managers, and executives understand the relative value of analytics, the complexity involved, the competitive advantage, and the personal benefit that will be gained from supporting you and your team is a worthwhile endeavor and activity and one that you and your team need to continually engage in. Bring along the functional team in each project and your efforts will be supported, funded, and rewarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Executive Expectations\n",
    "Working across the organization is a critical element of the success of you and your team. Engaging with and gaining the support of executives is a requirement for success. Working with **executives** to support their needs in order for them to support your needs is a fact of life. Embrace their needs, support and feed what they need, and you and your team will have a much easier time navigating the organization and obtaining the support and funding that is required to do the work you love.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Executives** may not understand what you do or what motivates you, but that doesn't really matter. They do not need to understand you, your team, and the work you do. You need to `illustrate to them in terms that they can understand that you and your team are a good investment that will deliver valuable results and impact at a faster and higher rate than other investments`. You will be required to engage in selective and strategic selling and sales activities to convince the upper echelons of the firm to secure and maintain funding for your personal efforts and to support the efforts of your advanced analytics and AI teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep in mind that an `organization is a collection of competing strategies, projects, and functional areas`. You need corporate sponsorship from **executives**. The reality of the matter is that you need sponsorship and money and you need to ensure that the executive team or at least your sponsor on the executive team continues to support and fund the efforts of your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Executive**s can only keep a certain amount of complexity and breadth of activity in mind at any one time. When they see that your efforts, and the efforts of your team, are supporting strategic initiatives, then you are aligned with their thinking and you will have their support. `It is not their job to understand what you and your team are doing`. It is their job to lead the company and make strategic decisions and to be accountable for those decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `It is your job to ensure that `**executives**` understand how the efforts of you and your team align with where they are attempting to take the company. You must work hard at keeping them informed`, and to you, it may seem like a waste of time and you may also think that it is not \"work\" since it is not building something of value. Well, let me tell you, it is an important – no – `it is a critical portion of your primary work duties`. You need to support your team in securing the support of the executive team or at least your executive sponsor. Without their support, you will not have a team or the resources to do the work you love.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your focus and efforts, at least in this area, need to be on refining and honing your ability to connect with senior managers and **executives** on their level in a voice that they can hear. `Speak their language and your success will come much more easily`. Executive communications are easy to understand but can be challenging to successfully navigate. For the most part, **executives**` want simple, fast, easy-to-understand answers that convey that the work you are undertaking has a significant positive impact` that will be realized in the corporate or financial reporting period that they have on their mind at the time of your discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `You need to know what the expectations are from the executives and senior managers that you will be engaging with`. You need to be certain that you, and your team, can deliver at the required scale and speed. If you cannot, for whatever reason, find a different functional area to engage with or a project to undertake.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to assume that the **executives** you are engaging with `have little to no knowledge` of any part of this environment, and at the same time, they have very little interest in the topic. They may have a strong interest in the possible outcome(s) and changes that can be driven through analytics, but it may be dangerous to assume anything more than a passing fancy for the topic. Complexity combined with little to no knowledge, and a small amount of interest mixed with a healthy dose of executive ego makes for a volatile mix. `Never underestimate the cycle of lack of understanding/interest, followed by confusion, quickly leading to embarrassment, concluding with lashing out and condemnation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Be clear, concise and on message`. If you can say it in 45 seconds, that is great, but 30 seconds is even better. You can do it. Being concise is the product of focus, effort, and the refinement of what you want to communicate. Work on refining this skill – it will pay off.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `When you are presenting to `**executives**`, you need to show them what is good and explain why it is good`. Do not assume executives and senior managers understand what you are talking about. If it is good news, tell them, and show them why, ensuring to frame the story in the way you want to define it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cultivating, assessing, and obtaining executive support starts even before you join the organization. When interviewing for a new role and when new executives subsequently join the organization who have a direct or indirect impact on your team size, funding, and future plans, `you need to evaluate the executives and senior managers to understand their history, perspective, and experience with analytics teams`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensuring Engagement with Business Professionals (Functional Business Leaders and Managers)\n",
    "Most of your stakeholders want to leverage and utilize data and analytics, but they do not know how to achieve this goal. Part of your job is to help them understand how to navigate this journey successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-analytics world:** Organizational culture is a powerful force, and that force, in the majority of `organizations around the world, tends toward stasis or even active resistance to deep structural change`. While many of us think that if a good idea is developed and presented, the organization will adopt it, that is not true in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **We in analytics are different:** `we like complexity, we like change, and we do not only like change, we seek to change things in a proactive and engaged manner`. Most people do not have that mental orientation or personal constitution; most middle managers seek to actively avoid change. We just need to realize that where the analytics team seeks and sees change, middle managers see danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The analytics team needs to **design a change process as part of every project**` and the analytics team and the project management or change management team needs to help the functional teams to move through the prescribed change`. Although we argue that engaging the data science team to manage and drive this change is a waste of time and money, the organization needs to have another group, like a **project management or change management group**, that is chartered with driving the process and operational changes required to realize the value of the insights and intelligence generated by the advanced analytics team. The **project management team** is, in all likelihood, not part of the **advanced analytics and AI team**, but they are the team or group that the analytics team can hand off change management processes to. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Most people find change hard**. The processes that the advanced analytics team changes with data and analytics might represent especially hard changes for an organization. The analytics team needs to consider the reticence of the organization and plan for how to overcome the tendency to the status quo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Never before in history have we had the combination of math, volumes of diverse and readily accessible data and the power to compute it that we now have at our finger-tips. When we have all three of these fundamental elements working together in real time and on a continuous basis, we can produce valid scalable results in real time that can be used to monitor and manage almost any process in an automated fashion. The main point is that it is not data or algorithms, it is **data and algorithms**. They each reinforce the value of the other and amplify their impacts in an evolving and dynamic manner. Don't let people simplify the equation or need for investment and focus to one or the other - **both are required for success and successful change**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another real and present reason for the lack of progress in developing and leveraging data and analytics is the **talent gap** (STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math)). Hiring managers cannot find and hire enough talented people to build, manage, and maintain a rich, growing, and evolving analytical ecosystem across all of the industries, geographies, and companies that want to build out their analytics capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When encountering multidimensional challenges, timing is important**. Each portion of the ecosystem—talent, tools, culture, and more—can be mutually reinforcing or destructive. If you hire talent and do not have tools, the teams will be restless and question whether management is committed to analytics. If you have tools and talent, but no widespread support for using data and analytics, your results will suffer. It is important to build support with management, invest in tools, engage with a broad community to build grassroots support, use data and analytics, and then finally hire more than a handful of talented analytics professionals to begin working on projects with stakeholders and subject matter experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selling a project\n",
    "Analytics projects, the analytics team, and the support for the overall analytics effort needs to be funded and supported. What is the best path and method for selling the value of an analytics process and all the projects that are included in the total program to the executive level? `Sell the entire process and program and lay out the various major projects/phases that will be executed over time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executives are looking for impact from investments**. It is best to `start with the most expansive impact and headline possible`. If you are proposing to transform a corporate function, like the supply chain, start with the broadest view that you can apply analytics to. You need to find out through research and internal discussions the threshold of impact for an executive to have interest in funding and sponsoring the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation on selling the value:\n",
    "- **Construct an analytics process that delivers multiples of the minimum value or return required**. `Illustrate and communicate the big picture`. Ensure that the messaging includes the appropriate corporate stance – thought leader, fast follower, laggard, etc.\n",
    "- **Frame the analytics process as a defined corporate initiative or program**. Make sure that the program connects with a strategic imperative stated by the executive level of the company.\n",
    "- **Define a series of projects** that start small, deliver results, and scale over time building increasing value and transformation for the operations of the company.\n",
    "- Wrap it up with a tiered **request for funding and support** and you should be off and running with the support of the executives and a series of projects to execute on.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last piece of advice in entering the executive suite: `go in with confidence and go big`. **Executives**`, for the most part, like big ideas and they want to hear about ideas that will change the course of the company`. Go big – plan for and present initiatives and programs that will require risk, investment, and time. `By going big and presenting a vision, you will have their attention, and, in many cases, they will fund and support your plans`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimations, Deadlines\n",
    "Discovery-oriented processes are different and will take more time, and it is notoriously difficult to estimate and predict when the discovery will be unearthed. We need to be clear with our collaborators from functional teams that their deadlines are of interest to the analytical team, but those deadlines do not drive the analytics team's work cycles or products. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality\n",
    "The analytics team wants to, and is eager to, collaborate, but the `analytics cycle takes time to complete`. One element of analytics work that we need to `protect is the time to test and validate the results of our models and applications`. It is paramount that the analytics team test, retest, and validate that the results are accurate and reliable. Releasing an inaccurate model or application will have far-reaching and negative consequences for all involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Drift\n",
    "When the data being generated in the current operations has changed and the status of the current environment is different than the data that was used to train the locked models that are currently in a production system, analytical professionals will refer to this as `model drift`. Data coming from source systems has changed, not the models. Analytics professionals need to work with functional staff members for them to understand that trained models are products of data that represents a point in time. When the world has moved on from that point in time, the models that describe and predict the characteristics of that phenomenon need to be updated. Those updates could be real-time and continuous, or they could be of a longer refresh cycle."

    "## Analytics Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow of Actions\n",
    "- Once the **data is cleaned, integrated, and accessible**, the data scientists are ready to start exploring the dataset. **Descriptive statistics** are often employed to understand the size, shape, relationships, density/sparseness, correlations, and other relationships in the data. These early steps lead the analytics team into the feature engineering phase of the analytics process. The data may have all the features required to build highly predictive models, but the data may contain hundreds or thousands of variables. How does the data scientist discern which variables or combinations of variables are the most predictive while not including factors that are confirmatory of the behavior or phenomena that is to be discovered or predicted?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Without delving too deeply into the art and science of **feature engineering**, much of this portion of the analytics process is guided by data reduction techniques, aided with intuition from the analytics professionals, supported by mathematical experience and expertise, and extended and refined through the utilization of domain knowledge and expertise from the subject matter experts. Does that sound like it is a straightforward process? It can be, but most often it is not. In most cases, it is a few months of **trial and error, experimentation, dead ends, and frustrating failures of concepts and hypotheses, followed ultimately by either eventual success or a disappointing realization that the data does not support the theory, or that the data needed to model the phenomena or behavior does not exist or cannot be obtained in the form, volume, or frequency needed to predict the activity of interest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are a wide ranges of techniques and tools that data scientists have at their disposal, and again they will employ all the elements described in the paragraph above to determine which approach and technique or series of techniques will result in the timely production of results needed to feed into a production environment to drive improved operational results. We most often hear people talking about neural networks, AI, and machine learning. There are also the techniques of clustering, classification, natural language processing, complex event processing, simulation, optimization, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After the model has been developed, the data scientist, in conjunction with the collaborators, will iteratively cycle through the next three steps (that is, **Model Validation, Back Testing, and Model Tuning**) in the analytics process until the model performs in a predictable, performant manner that provides an improvement in the ability to describe or predict the behavior or phenomena of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the initial project has delivered, tested, and validated results from the models, time needs to be allotted for **the functional team to vet, analyze, understand, and accept the results as valid and an improvement over the previous system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Winning Projects\n",
    "**Winning projects** are those analytics projects that are widely understood by business executives, sponsors, subject matter experts, project review members, portfolio managers, finance professionals, and the analytics team.\n",
    "- `Winning projects are prioritized in the analytics backlog and chosen as areas of strategic and tactical importance to the success and improved operations of the company`. The most important and selected analytics projects are then measured and compared to a wide range of other projects that the company needs to execute, and the final selection process is undertaken. The resulting projects have been carefully scoped, vetted, and funded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Those projects are the projects that will deliver value to the company`. Those projects have been shepherded through the selection process and have broad support across the organization. The analytics team and project team from the business function has the support and air cover they need to execute these chosen, winning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everyone has the option of selecting the projects that they or their team will undertake. In most business situations, people are directed to the projects that they will be undertaking. Having a choice of the work that we and our teams will engage in is a fulfilling and energizing element of running an advanced analytics and artificial intelligence team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introductory projects\n",
    "It is unclear in certain circumstances if the sponsoring stakeholders or subject matter experts are fully committed to the project that you are chartered to undertake. Of course, they will say that they want to engage, and they will assign people to support the efforts of the advanced analytics and AI team, but they may not even know the implications of engaging in an analytics project. It is almost certainly the case that they do not know the full implications of engaging in the project and the results that will be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first project you do with a new functional area, a new manager, or an executive that you do not have an existing relationship with should be a short project**. You should break down the initial stage of the project into a piece of work that can be completed and presented with compelling results in 2 to 4 months. End users cannot see or envision the results that they will receive and be expected to work with, and they are even less capable of understanding the cascade of changes that will need to be enacted to realize the full benefits of a data and analytics-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sponsors and stakeholders will in most cases be impressed that you and your team are committing to deliver results so quickly. They will have little to no knowledge that you are doing this for your benefit more than theirs. What happens in most cases is that you and your team will illustrate an interesting insight or find a result that is not intuitive. `You can use this finding to open the discussion regarding planning the phase of the work, where the analytical application or predictive model(s) become part of the newly re-engineered production proces`s. Most managers will not act surprised, but I can guarantee you that they will be surprised and may resist implementing the changes, but you need to push forward. You need to gently persist in the belief that the data, insights, and analyses are leading to an improvement in pricing, operations, marketing, or whatever functional business unit you are analyzing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The projects that the advanced analytics team undertakes need to have visibility to your management team, to the management team of the functional area, and to the executive leadership team**. `This visibility is best achieved through written, verbal, and personal communication`.\n",
    "- **Visibility to the management** of the analytics team and to the functional team is best achieved through routine status reports and personal meetings. \n",
    "- **Visibility to the company** is best achieved through company bulletins, newsletters, company app updates, social media channels, and other communication vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projects Selection Process\n",
    "**Develop, present, and clarify detailed project plans and proposals** that can be easily and fairly compared with competing projects, and it is the duty of the project review board or executives or other managers to provide sufficient review, governance, and guidance to all project managers on why projects are being selected and undertaken and why others are being deferred or rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most executives and many managers look at analytics projects as technology projects and they do not delve into the details of making an informed decision of which projects deliver the most immediate, and greater overall, value to the company. We need to **make evaluating an advanced analytics project as easy as possible**. We do not need to \"dumb it down,\" but we do need make the scope, scale, time frame, resources required, transformational potential, possible range of returns, and long- and short-term value clear to decision makers. For this we can use project charters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project charters** are brief descriptions of projects combining most important information about the goal, business value, main stakeholders (including a project review board). It is used to gather all interesting ideas and compare them. Make them visible to all interested parties. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Project charters** help in: \n",
    "- better understanding of the needs and gaps (scope, business context, like missing data), \n",
    "- assessing feasibility (data availability, cost and budget availability, resources, people's skills, timeframe, etc.),\n",
    "- communication about potential projects, their value, scope, etc., \n",
    "- collaboration on deciding about execution go/no-go,\n",
    "- agreeing on different projects' priorities based on on business impact and business need (and next steps, like closing the identified gaps before project start).\n",
    "\n",

    "### The project mix – small and large - keep stakeholders and sponsors engaged\n",
    "The **project mix** has a great deal to do with stakeholder engagement, team satisfaction, and workload consistency. A senior data scientist can work on two major projects and multiple smaller projects, around two or three, all simultaneously. `By having a portfolio of work that encompasses five or six projects, the analytics team always had work available to them, they did not have lapses where they had nothing to do`. They can also learn that scheduling is one of the most underrated skills and that by improving their ability to estimate work and plan for unexpected delays that their work portfolio could be much larger and they would not be working any harder than they were before, but that they can be much more productive and they can have a much broader network in the organization and a broader sphere of influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Daily operations\n",
    "Set up the focus and cadence of the analytical team's daily work to ensure that they are engaged in the right type of work and are delivering in a manner that optimizes their productivity and the visibility of the work to the relevant executives, senior managers, and subject matter experts across the organization.\n",
    "- **Quick wins:** Everyone agrees that quick wins are good. Everyone wants to get off to a fast start and to deliver value and positive results as soon as possible, but you need to ensure that you and the executives you are conferring with are on the same page and have the same expectations. Make sure that you have an agreement as to what terms like quickly, short-term, very soon, and other related terms mean to the executives you are engaging with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Service requests:** Service requests can be thought of as small projects – projects that you can use to create goodwill and trust with executives that you are just meeting and getting to know. Often, executives will have a list of problems or challenges or curiosities that they have not been able to obtain answers for. In many cases, the advanced analytics and AI team can quickly and easily answer these questions for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Innovation:** Executives signed off on the investment for you, your team, and the supporting infrastructure, technology and related expenses. Given all that we have talked about in the current business and general climate around advanced analytics and AI, there will, in all likelihood, be an expectation that innovation will result. Operations will change and the executives will be able to represent in interviews to the press, and in meetings with stakeholders, and in investors calls, that they have invested in the hot new space of data and analytics. Innovation is almost an effortless byproduct of the work you and your team execute on a daily basis. Be ready to talk about and produce stories that the communications team can revise and package for the executive team."

    "Advanced analytics and AI projects and efforts can become exceptionally long term and conceptual if not designed, directed, and managed appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may happen that **if the change in functional team or process is going to be significant, from the beginning of the project, the final phase of the project needed to be focused on change management rather than model delivery**. If your analytics team is an artisanal team and is small in number, you may employ another group that is focused on change management to help work as a third party with the analytics team and the functional team to design and implement the organizational changes required to realize the full benefits of the analytics project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point to be considered here is that **change will be required**, and in some cases significant change, to leverage the results of analytics projects, and `it is better to overtly communicate to, and plan with, the functional teams` rather than to wait for them to realize that change is needed and that the change can and will be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never assume that the functional team or the management of the functional team understands** the full breadth and depth of the analytics that you and your team are building and the full impact and benefit of the changes that will be required from them and their organization and operation. `Be overt and be clear about all the changes that you, your team, and the third-party change management group can see and anticipate`.\n",
