    "### Experiment is a type of study\n",
    "As you may already know, an experiment is a type of study. Whenever we choose to analyze data, whether it's data already in a database or data we collected ourselves, we always have to have some sort of study design behind it. An experiment is just one type of study design. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the features of experimental study designs, it's helpful to understand the other study designs first. I'm going to explain them to you using terminology from my field, which is public health. But please understand that the same study designs might be called something different in another field, such as psychology. But lucky for you, in every field, we all agree on what an experiment is. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_001.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In epidemiology, I find it helpful to think of the study designs not as equals but as a hierarchy, so I'm going to show you this helpful diagram I call the study design hierarchy. It starts at the top with human research, which is epidemiologists do, and if you are studying user behavior in your experiment, you will be researching humans as well. Let's start going down the hierarchy. Our first stop on the left side of the diagram is called `observational studies`. These are where we collect data about humans by simply recording what they do naturally. Perhaps I enroll a group of people who suffer migraines in a study, and ask them to record what medications they take when they get sick. If I do that, I'm just observing their behavior. This seems like a nice study design, right? Well, it is nice, but there are caveats. Let's move down the hierarchy from observational and you will see that it splits. On one side we have `descriptive studies`. Descriptive study designs do not test a hypothesis, but simply try to describe the data. You will learn more about this in this course actually because it is necessary to do some descriptive analysis as part of preparation for an experiment. Here, you will see the other way that observational studies split is called `analytic`. Those study designs are intended to test hypotheses. And trust me, they are really challenging. Remember, when you have a hypothesis, you are trying to figure out a cause, and in an analytic study, you are trying to test a hypothesis, but the data are very biased. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll give you some examples. I'm vegetarian and I also do yoga, and if you look in the world, you'll find a lot of people who are vegetarian and do yoga. Many video game fans are also comic books fans, and many history buffs like to both read about history and visit historical museums. So these observational biases, while interesting, can interfere with being able to tell what causes what in the data. So if I find out in my observational study that vegetarians are healthier than everyone else, is it because they are vegetarian, or because a lot of them do yoga? Or could it be caused by some other healthy behavior they do that we don't even know about? So we have this problem with being able to tell what caused what. This is where `experiment` comes in. Let's go back to the study design hierarchy. You will see I added experiment as a type of human research, opposite to observational studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_002.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In `experiment`, you are not simply observing what people are doing. You are actually controlling what they are doing. Well, only to some extent. There are boundaries and limitations. In fact, you will learn about those later in the course. But that basic idea that the researcher controls the choices, not the research participant, is the hallmark of an experiment. It is what makes an experiment different from an observational study. So, although we will do some descriptive analysis in this course to prepare for our experiment, the focus of this course will be on the specific steps to take when conducting a data science experiment."

    "### Features of an experiment\n",
    "Now we are going to look at specific features of experiments. This study design hierarchy diagram is one that I've shown you before. Just as a reminder, the experiment is counterpoised against or basically the opposite of an observational study. In an `observational study`, the researcher collects data about humans but does not assign them to do anything they would not normally do. In contrast, in an `experiment`, the researcher actually makes choices for the research participant and controls their choices in the study. So that is the first feature I want you to remember about experiments, and that is `in an experiment, the researcher makes choices for the participants`. Not the participant. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_003.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get into the details of what I mean by choices. Here is what the researcher assigns in an experiment, the conditions. Let's talk about the word conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_004.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In experimental research, the word `condition` roughly means the environment in which the study or research occurred. Think of a study testing a new uniform for army soldiers. One condition might be desert and one might be rainy. So another feature of an experiment is that `you need at least two conditions and the goal is to compare the conditions`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's sum what we have gone over so far as features of experiments, but let me put them in a slightly different way. We just talked about how experiments need to have at least two conditions, so you can compare them and tell which is better. Earlier, we talked about another feature of an experiment, which is that the researcher makes choices for the participants. Actually, the technical term for participants is experimental units, which means the type of entity on which you are doing your experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_005.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "`So the two features of experimental design we have talked about so far are that the experiment must have at least two comparable conditions and that the researcher must be the one to assign the participants to the conditions, not the participants themselves`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_006.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So why would you ever do an experiment? As I showed you earlier, you could just do an observational study. That way, you would not need any conditions and you would not need to assign anyone to them. But `experimental design is really what you need if you want to see if something new is better without completely converting over to the new way`. In an experiment, the old way can be one condition and the new way can be the other condition, and you can compare them. That way, you have the information to choose whether or not to convert to the new way or stay with the old way. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_006.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So up to now, experiments might sound like a pretty good deal but a lot of people do not appreciate how much work they are. Imagine an app developer who develops her app with a blue color scheme and wonders if users would respond more positively to a green color scheme. To do an experiment, she would basically have to build two versions of the app, one blue and one green. This would be a lot of work, especially if it was found at the end of the experiment that the blue-themed app was preferable. And it is also effort intensive and time consuming to keep all these assignments straight and to collect two different buckets of data, one for each condition. This is why you will find that observational studies are much more common than experiments. They are expensive and more work but on the other hand, experiments can be very valuable. Remember how I talked about all the bias involved in observational studies? That is what `all the effort in experiments is going towards, reducing the bias so you can see which condition is really better, the old way or the new way`. Experiments can provide uniquely valuable information that cannot be provided by other study designs. So under the right circumstances, the extra expense and time are worth it."

    "### Circumstances for experimental testing\n",
    "I'd like you to think about a thing you've studied over and over. I'm an epidemiologist, so I've studied a lot about certain diseases, but maybe you've studied your social media account over and over, trying to increase engagement. Or maybe you are a data analyst and have studied the behavior of your customers. Think about it, when you first encountered that topic, how did you study it? What study designs did you use? and didn't that lead to changes in the way you did things? Maybe you started using social media differently after seeing what posts or tweets work better than others. Or maybe you found parts of the database that were messy and cleaned them up. My point is that, if you do things right when studying the same thing over and over, you actually iterate in your study designs. You start by studying a problem, figuring out an `intervention` that you think would work to fix it, and applying it. If it doesn't work, you try something else. Which is a way of iterating. If it does work, that's great, but it means you can move on to `intervening` on another problem, and that's another way of iterating. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_008.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, what I mean by `intervention` is a change you make that intervenes on the system to make it run differently. One intervention you could do is fix a known problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've talked about how we can evolve and iterate through our study designs if we keep studying and working on the same topic over and over, I want to bring up the concept of `Scientific Equipoise`. It roughly `means scientifically equal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_009.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the concept we epidemiologists use to help us decide if we need to do an experiment. For example, to see what treatment works better for a certain disease. But since experiments are effort intensive and expensive, we want to choose wisely. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now just imagine I design this experiment. We want students to buy healthy food on a campus. So we give half of them a $20 gift card for healthy food and the other half we give $40 gift card and we want to see which group buys more food. Can you see what is wrong with this experiment? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, obviously, if you give someone $40 for free food and someone else $20 of free food, you can probably guess that the person given the $40 is going to go get more food. So these conditions are not at Scientific Equipoise. If you actually did an experiment like this it would be a waste of money because the two groups are not comparable. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_010.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how we could change the scenario to bring about Scientific Equipoise. Let's say we give both groups a $20 gift card but one group has to go to the cafeteria to redeem their card and get their food, and the other group can use an app to arrange for delivery of their $20 worth of food. Let's face it, we really don't know which one they would use more. In a colder climate, they may prefer the app. But in places where students like to meet in the cafeteria, they may prefer going out for food. \n",
    "\n",
    "`The point is, we really don't know which is better before we start the experiment`. When you really don't know at the beginning which group will be ahead at the end, then you have `Scientific Equipoise.` \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I want to return to talking about that thing you study all the time. Whatever it is. We are like the people on the slide. We feel the panic and the pain. We already know what the problems are. `Experiments are actually for when you run out of ideas on how to optimize your system`. Let's go back to the college students. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_011.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The college wants them to eat healthy food. There are a lot of things it could do to encourage this. Such as making healthy food cheap and available on campus. They don't need to do an experiment to surmise that this will help them optimize the part of their system that's trying to get college students to have good nutrition. Only after they do those things could they get any insight from the experiment I described earlier. If they don't first make sure there is healthy food available to the students, that experiment definitely will not work."

    "### When not to do an experiment\n",
    "I have a lot of customers coming to me wanting to do experiments at the wrong time. Maybe they just installed some new software at their workplace or they just upgraded their software or they just bought an additional location for their business. Or they just hired a volunteer coordinator. Whatever it is, let me just say, `when things are new, it's not necessary to do an experiment`. \n",

    "I know, I know, my customers are always itching to do experiments for some reason and they cry, \"But why?\" I just gently tell them, \"Let's think about it together. \"Let's logic this one out.\" Remember, an experiment is what you do after you've tried everything else. You are going to make some conditions, A and B, and they are going to be almost the same but different. `Condition A must be comparable to Condition B so B can only represent an incremental change from A`. But if you just did a new big thing, that's not an incremental change. That's a big change, and you did that for a reason, because you knew it would make things a whole lot better. That's why we upgrade software or hire volunteer coordinators or do whatever we do to make big changes in our business. We are being logical. Fixing big problems and preventing others. So the only way to realistically make changes to this hopefully new improved system is to have it settle down into a new normal before you start experimenting with incremental changes. \n",

    "It might be easier to illustrate with an example. I have this friend who works at this educational technology company. They offer online training for certification in some different occupations. So my friend told me that they recently upgraded their online application process to take their courses. They streamlined it so the application was easier to fill out. They were hoping they might get more customers that way as people had been complaining the application was too much trouble. So now that they had upgraded the application process, my friend wanted me to teach him how to design an experiment to determine what is the best format for the application process. Do you see any red flags with this request? They just recently upgraded because of complaints about the application process so they were aiming to fix these problems by doing the upgrade. Did the problems get fixed? We don't know yet. Since this place often has repeat customers, people who keep getting certified and re-certified, they have a lot of access to just talking to their customers. That's much more powerful than an experiment. \n",

    "\n",
    "I told my friend to have their new system settle down and see what their customers are thinking because if it wasn't perfect, we'd have to design conditions, condition A versus condition B. And `condition B should be some sort of improvement over A but we don't even know what is considered good`. The place said that their last process was bad. Now they fixed it hopefully. `So what is the new normal? You need to know that before you design an experiment`. `The system has to be so stable that you can predict the metrics you want to change. That way you can create a reasonable B condition that might improve that metric`. My friend was thinking of the components of the business, the application, the customers paying, the customers taking courses but in experimentation, you have to think of the whole system as one thing. `You are experimenting on the whole system, so the system must be stable before you contemplate an experiment`. You need to be able to imagine a better way, a slight incremental change to the system. You need to have stable predictable metrics in your system that you can measure reliably. \n",

The customers who I tell need to do experiments are the ones that are exasperated. They have tried everything to make their system better and they just don't know what to do next. They are often exhausted and not in the mood for an experiment but that's the perfect time! So ironic.\n",

    "### Systems ready for experimental testing\n",
    "So, when should you do an experiment? Now I'm going to talk to you about the perfect situation in which to do an experiment. Remember, a test is going to be done on the entire system, so the entire system has to be ready for testing, like that case study of my friend at the education company. If they change the application process for their courses, it will change everything about their system, like how many sales they will ultimately expect. But what I didn't really mention is `not only do you need to have the business part of the system in order before you do an experiment, but you need the management part of the system to be in order as well`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_017.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's imagine that the `business part` is in good shape for an experiment. Maybe you are on a team that launched an app last year and you have a stable customer base and you have not really changed your app in awhile. That's a very predictable system, `you know what to expect with your metrics and your system's performance`. That's an ideal state of business for an experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you have to turn to `management` and `find out what their priorities are, what do they want to improve?` Usually this is framed in terms of metrics, like they want sales to go up, or to increase web traffic hits, or increase customer signups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my friend's example, he wanted to increase applications to his online courses. So that's the first thing managers need to talk about with respect to the experiment. What are we trying to change exactly? Now you need management to get creative with you because `in each A/B experiment you can test only one change`. Remember how I said you can only choose one B condition to test per experiment, so you need to choose wisely? These managers can help you brainstorm what might be a good change to test. So have them help you prioritize. What is a top barrier we can remove to sales, or whatever metric is important? Or maybe a slight redesign of the app will increase sales. In fact, whatever your role in the organization, your experiment is the most useful if you actually interview management who are in the know about the challenges they are prioritizing and the metrics they really want to change. If you ask them directly, you can get great information around which to design your experiment. The take home message is that `you are really going to have to get management on board for any experiment to work`. Even if you are really smart yourself, if you don't have management there on your side, you will miss important perspectives. Management is what really knows all parts of the system and they need to okay changes to the system because they have a better idea of how those changes will impact the system. `They will need to help you be creative in designing the B condition because you will need them to commit to adopting the condition that wins in the experiment, either A or B`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_018.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if your system is in good shape for an experiment, you have to also ask yourself, is management on board and in it for the long haul? Because if they are not, then the experiment won't work. The experiment itself is problematic, it's time consuming, expensive, and often disruptive to different departments. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_019.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But imagine you've found a way to increase sales a lot by just a little change. That's why experiments can be worth the trouble, but only if management is really committed to it. If they are not, the experiment will likely be disrupted and you won't get a good read on the result. Or you'll get the result and management won't implement it. You really need to make sure management is in it for the long haul before embarking on an experiment."
