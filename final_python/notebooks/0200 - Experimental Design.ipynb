    "### Experiment is a type of study\n",
    "As you may already know, an experiment is a type of study. Whenever we choose to analyze data, whether it's data already in a database or data we collected ourselves, we always have to have some sort of study design behind it. An experiment is just one type of study design. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the features of experimental study designs, it's helpful to understand the other study designs first. I'm going to explain them to you using terminology from my field, which is public health. But please understand that the same study designs might be called something different in another field, such as psychology. But lucky for you, in every field, we all agree on what an experiment is. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_001.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In epidemiology, I find it helpful to think of the study designs not as equals but as a hierarchy, so I'm going to show you this helpful diagram I call the study design hierarchy. It starts at the top with human research, which is epidemiologists do, and if you are studying user behavior in your experiment, you will be researching humans as well. Let's start going down the hierarchy. Our first stop on the left side of the diagram is called `observational studies`. These are where we collect data about humans by simply recording what they do naturally. Perhaps I enroll a group of people who suffer migraines in a study, and ask them to record what medications they take when they get sick. If I do that, I'm just observing their behavior. This seems like a nice study design, right? Well, it is nice, but there are caveats. Let's move down the hierarchy from observational and you will see that it splits. On one side we have `descriptive studies`. Descriptive study designs do not test a hypothesis, but simply try to describe the data. You will learn more about this in this course actually because it is necessary to do some descriptive analysis as part of preparation for an experiment. Here, you will see the other way that observational studies split is called `analytic`. Those study designs are intended to test hypotheses. And trust me, they are really challenging. Remember, when you have a hypothesis, you are trying to figure out a cause, and in an analytic study, you are trying to test a hypothesis, but the data are very biased. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll give you some examples. I'm vegetarian and I also do yoga, and if you look in the world, you'll find a lot of people who are vegetarian and do yoga. Many video game fans are also comic books fans, and many history buffs like to both read about history and visit historical museums. So these observational biases, while interesting, can interfere with being able to tell what causes what in the data. So if I find out in my observational study that vegetarians are healthier than everyone else, is it because they are vegetarian, or because a lot of them do yoga? Or could it be caused by some other healthy behavior they do that we don't even know about? So we have this problem with being able to tell what caused what. This is where `experiment` comes in. Let's go back to the study design hierarchy. You will see I added experiment as a type of human research, opposite to observational studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_002.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In `experiment`, you are not simply observing what people are doing. You are actually controlling what they are doing. Well, only to some extent. There are boundaries and limitations. In fact, you will learn about those later in the course. But that basic idea that the researcher controls the choices, not the research participant, is the hallmark of an experiment. It is what makes an experiment different from an observational study. So, although we will do some descriptive analysis in this course to prepare for our experiment, the focus of this course will be on the specific steps to take when conducting a data science experiment."

    "### Features of an experiment\n",
    "Now we are going to look at specific features of experiments. This study design hierarchy diagram is one that I've shown you before. Just as a reminder, the experiment is counterpoised against or basically the opposite of an observational study. In an `observational study`, the researcher collects data about humans but does not assign them to do anything they would not normally do. In contrast, in an `experiment`, the researcher actually makes choices for the research participant and controls their choices in the study. So that is the first feature I want you to remember about experiments, and that is `in an experiment, the researcher makes choices for the participants`. Not the participant. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_003.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get into the details of what I mean by choices. Here is what the researcher assigns in an experiment, the conditions. Let's talk about the word conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_004.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In experimental research, the word `condition` roughly means the environment in which the study or research occurred. Think of a study testing a new uniform for army soldiers. One condition might be desert and one might be rainy. So another feature of an experiment is that `you need at least two conditions and the goal is to compare the conditions`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's sum what we have gone over so far as features of experiments, but let me put them in a slightly different way. We just talked about how experiments need to have at least two conditions, so you can compare them and tell which is better. Earlier, we talked about another feature of an experiment, which is that the researcher makes choices for the participants. Actually, the technical term for participants is experimental units, which means the type of entity on which you are doing your experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_005.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "`So the two features of experimental design we have talked about so far are that the experiment must have at least two comparable conditions and that the researcher must be the one to assign the participants to the conditions, not the participants themselves`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_006.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So why would you ever do an experiment? As I showed you earlier, you could just do an observational study. That way, you would not need any conditions and you would not need to assign anyone to them. But `experimental design is really what you need if you want to see if something new is better without completely converting over to the new way`. In an experiment, the old way can be one condition and the new way can be the other condition, and you can compare them. That way, you have the information to choose whether or not to convert to the new way or stay with the old way. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_006.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So up to now, experiments might sound like a pretty good deal but a lot of people do not appreciate how much work they are. Imagine an app developer who develops her app with a blue color scheme and wonders if users would respond more positively to a green color scheme. To do an experiment, she would basically have to build two versions of the app, one blue and one green. This would be a lot of work, especially if it was found at the end of the experiment that the blue-themed app was preferable. And it is also effort intensive and time consuming to keep all these assignments straight and to collect two different buckets of data, one for each condition. This is why you will find that observational studies are much more common than experiments. They are expensive and more work but on the other hand, experiments can be very valuable. Remember how I talked about all the bias involved in observational studies? That is what `all the effort in experiments is going towards, reducing the bias so you can see which condition is really better, the old way or the new way`. Experiments can provide uniquely valuable information that cannot be provided by other study designs. So under the right circumstances, the extra expense and time are worth it."

    "### Circumstances for experimental testing\n",
    "I'd like you to think about a thing you've studied over and over. I'm an epidemiologist, so I've studied a lot about certain diseases, but maybe you've studied your social media account over and over, trying to increase engagement. Or maybe you are a data analyst and have studied the behavior of your customers. Think about it, when you first encountered that topic, how did you study it? What study designs did you use? and didn't that lead to changes in the way you did things? Maybe you started using social media differently after seeing what posts or tweets work better than others. Or maybe you found parts of the database that were messy and cleaned them up. My point is that, if you do things right when studying the same thing over and over, you actually iterate in your study designs. You start by studying a problem, figuring out an `intervention` that you think would work to fix it, and applying it. If it doesn't work, you try something else. Which is a way of iterating. If it does work, that's great, but it means you can move on to `intervening` on another problem, and that's another way of iterating. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_008.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, what I mean by `intervention` is a change you make that intervenes on the system to make it run differently. One intervention you could do is fix a known problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've talked about how we can evolve and iterate through our study designs if we keep studying and working on the same topic over and over, I want to bring up the concept of `Scientific Equipoise`. It roughly `means scientifically equal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_009.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the concept we epidemiologists use to help us decide if we need to do an experiment. For example, to see what treatment works better for a certain disease. But since experiments are effort intensive and expensive, we want to choose wisely. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now just imagine I design this experiment. We want students to buy healthy food on a campus. So we give half of them a \\\\$20 gift card for healthy food and the other half we give \\\\$40 gift card and we want to see which group buys more food. Can you see what is wrong with this experiment? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, obviously, if you give someone \\\\$40 for free food and someone else \\\\$20 of free food, you can probably guess that the person given the $40 is going to go get more food. So these conditions are not at Scientific Equipoise. If you actually did an experiment like this it would be a waste of money because the two groups are not comparable. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_010.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how we could change the scenario to bring about Scientific Equipoise. Let's say we give both groups a \\\\$20 gift card but one group has to go to the cafeteria to redeem their card and get their food, and the other group can use an app to arrange for delivery of their \\\\$20 worth of food. Let's face it, we really don't know which one they would use more. In a colder climate, they may prefer the app. But in places where students like to meet in the cafeteria, they may prefer going out for food. \n",
    "\n",
    "`The point is, we really don't know which is better before we start the experiment`. When you really don't know at the beginning which group will be ahead at the end, then you have `Scientific Equipoise.` \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I want to return to talking about that thing you study all the time. Whatever it is. We are like the people on the slide. We feel the panic and the pain. We already know what the problems are. `Experiments are actually for when you run out of ideas on how to optimize your system`. Let's go back to the college students. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_011.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The college wants them to eat healthy food. There are a lot of things it could do to encourage this. Such as making healthy food cheap and available on campus. They don't need to do an experiment to surmise that this will help them optimize the part of their system that's trying to get college students to have good nutrition. Only after they do those things could they get any insight from the experiment I described earlier. If they don't first make sure there is healthy food available to the students, that experiment definitely will not work."

    "### When not to do an experiment\n",
    "I have a lot of customers coming to me wanting to do experiments at the wrong time. Maybe they just installed some new software at their workplace or they just upgraded their software or they just bought an additional location for their business. Or they just hired a volunteer coordinator. Whatever it is, let me just say, `when things are new, it's not necessary to do an experiment`. \n",

You are going to make some conditions, A and B, and they are going to be almost the same but different. `Condition A must be comparable to Condition B so B can only represent an incremental change from A`. But if you just did a new big thing, that's not an incremental change. That's a big change, and you did that for a reason, because you knew it would make things a whole lot better. That's why we upgrade software or hire volunteer coordinators or do whatever we do to make big changes in our business. We are being logical. Fixing big problems and preventing others. So the only way to realistically make changes to this hopefully new improved system is to have it settle down into a new normal before you start experimenting with incremental changes. \n",

    "It might be easier to illustrate with an example. I have this friend who works at this educational technology company. They offer online training for certification in some different occupations. So my friend told me that they recently upgraded their online application process to take their courses. They streamlined it so the application was easier to fill out. They were hoping they might get more customers that way as people had been complaining the application was too much trouble. So now that they had upgraded the application process, my friend wanted me to teach him how to design an experiment to determine what is the best format for the application process. Do you see any red flags with this request? They just recently upgraded because of complaints about the application process so they were aiming to fix these problems by doing the upgrade. Did the problems get fixed? We don't know yet. Since this place often has repeat customers, people who keep getting certified and re-certified, they have a lot of access to just talking to their customers. That's much more powerful than an experiment. \n",

Now they fixed it hopefully. `So what is the new normal? You need to know that before you design an experiment`. `The system has to be so stable that you can predict the metrics you want to change. That way you can create a reasonable B condition that might improve that metric`. My friend was thinking of the components of the business, the application, the customers paying, the customers taking courses but in experimentation, you have to think of the whole system as one thing. `You are experimenting on the whole system, so the system must be stable before you contemplate an experiment`. You need to be able to imagine a better way, a slight incremental change to the system. You need to have stable predictable metrics in your system that you can measure reliably. \n",

The customers who I tell need to do experiments are the ones that are exasperated. They have tried everything to make their system better and they just don't know what to do next. They are often exhausted and not in the mood for an experiment but that's the perfect time! So ironic.\n",

    "### Systems ready for experimental testing\n",
    "So, when should you do an experiment? Now I'm going to talk to you about the perfect situation in which to do an experiment. Remember, a test is going to be done on the entire system, so the entire system has to be ready for testing, like that case study of my friend at the education company. If they change the application process for their courses, it will change everything about their system, like how many sales they will ultimately expect. But what I didn't really mention is `not only do you need to have the business part of the system in order before you do an experiment, but you need the management part of the system to be in order as well`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_017.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's imagine that the `business part` is in good shape for an experiment. Maybe you are on a team that launched an app last year and you have a stable customer base and you have not really changed your app in awhile. That's a very predictable system, `you know what to expect with your metrics and your system's performance`. That's an ideal state of business for an experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you have to turn to `management` and `find out what their priorities are, what do they want to improve?` Usually this is framed in terms of metrics, like they want sales to go up, or to increase web traffic hits, or increase customer signups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my friend's example, he wanted to increase applications to his online courses. So that's the first thing managers need to talk about with respect to the experiment. What are we trying to change exactly? Now you need management to get creative with you because `in each A/B experiment you can test only one change`. Remember how I said you can only choose one B condition to test per experiment, so you need to choose wisely? These managers can help you brainstorm what might be a good change to test. So have them help you prioritize. What is a top barrier we can remove to sales, or whatever metric is important? Or maybe a slight redesign of the app will increase sales. In fact, whatever your role in the organization, your experiment is the most useful if you actually interview management who are in the know about the challenges they are prioritizing and the metrics they really want to change. If you ask them directly, you can get great information around which to design your experiment. The take home message is that `you are really going to have to get management on board for any experiment to work`. Even if you are really smart yourself, if you don't have management there on your side, you will miss important perspectives. Management is what really knows all parts of the system and they need to okay changes to the system because they have a better idea of how those changes will impact the system. `They will need to help you be creative in designing the B condition because you will need them to commit to adopting the condition that wins in the experiment, either A or B`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_018.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if your system is in good shape for an experiment, you have to also ask yourself, is management on board and in it for the long haul? Because if they are not, then the experiment won't work. The experiment itself is problematic, it's time consuming, expensive, and often disruptive to different departments. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_019.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But imagine you've found a way to increase sales a lot by just a little change. That's why experiments can be worth the trouble, but only if management is really committed to it. If they are not, the experiment will likely be disrupted and you won't get a good read on the result. Or you'll get the result and management won't implement it. You really need to make sure management is in it for the long haul before embarking on an experiment."

In another, I kept the star blue and put a yellow dot on it. In the third, I kept the star blue, but just made it a little bigger. This visual demonstrates making one little change to condition A. The thing is, to represent condition B, I only made one change to the star, like I did not change the color and the size at the same time for condition B. `In AB testing, you can only make one change from condition A to condition B. So, basically you can only choose one condition B for the whole experiment`. So, that actually becomes the difficult thing, choosing what the exact change you are going to make to condition A to test as conditioned B. Because the idea is if you find condition B is better, then you will want to throw away A and start using B. \n",
    "\n",
    "`And you'd be surprised that I run into this common problem when coaching people on experimental design.

Aha, I made you realize why we are not using the imagined conditioned B of the \\\\$90 purse right now, because then our business of selling purses would lose money. We'd lose \\\\$10 per purse. That's why we are charging \\\\$100 in the first place. So, `the conditions must represent an equal trade-off`. I assume if you are selling purses, you have already set the price that you need to have in order to break even in your business.

    "`The goal of an experiment is typically to figure out the best way to maximize conversions`. But let's stop and think about the word conversion for a moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I was a little girl, my grandfather sold some boutique health products. He didn't have many customers, mostly family and friends. But when we go to his sales meetings, they would talk about making a list of leads or potential customers. And then going to visit the leads and demonstrate the product. If the lead bought the product, they would convert to a customer. So a conversion was basically a customer buying something, a sale and that's pretty easy to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_026.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward, now I'm an adult, and we have the internet. The internet is interesting, because when you buy something on the internet, you usually do all this pre sales behavior. Looking at products, maybe joining a mailing list, or liking a social media post. These are all conversions, but not like my grandfather would think about them. This means there are more options for different types of conversions with social media and the internet. So things got more interesting, but also more complicated. Now there were more marketing channels. And because we could capture data along the way of the customer's journey, we could optimize how we use these channels to get to the customer. So while we have an opportunity to do a really good job of marketing now, which we did not have before, we also have more decisions to make and more to think about. It definitely got more complicated than when my grandpa was selling his health products. So the goal of an experiment, should be to figure out the best way to get conversions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you should have readied to your system, and have it be in condition A. Which is the condition that represents your best attempt at getting all the types of conversions you want out of your website, social media effort or whatever you are doing that you want conversions. Of course, you may be trying to get different types of conversions with one campaign, maybe increase your blog readers, increase your emailing list and also get sales.\n",

    "`The main advantage of an experiment, is that you can take a system that is an optimal shape like you think it is getting the most conversions you can, and test one little change and see if it actually increases conversions`. It's a good way to get guidance on whether you should actually make that change. Remember, a change could increase some kinds of conversions and decrease others. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you try to rebrand your website to appeal to a younger audience, your brand may attract more social media followers, since social media is dominated by younger people, but you might have lower sales, as younger people tend to have less disposable income than older people. Therefore, you want to be fully informed on what the impact will be of the change. And an experiment can do that for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are really going to hang our hat on these conversions, we really need to know what we are talking about. We might have multiple kinds of conversions as I said, and we might even care about specific types of conversions, like selling a particular item, rather than just making a sale. This means we have to count conversions. So we have to get in the business of doing a good job of counting. And to do that, you have to define exactly what you are counting. And more importantly, you have to make sure what you are counting is important. \n",

    "But imagine we had to compare conversions. Let's say we had two different online stores selling the same products. They were just branded differently. If we had 100 sales conversions at both online stores, without knowing what the traffic is at the stores, that number would not mean much. Let's say one store gets a thousand hits a day, and the other gets a million hits a day. The fact that they both have a hundred conversions, does not tell the whole story. We don't want to compare conversions. Instead we want to be able to make a rate, which is a fraction with a numerator and a denominator and compare rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_029.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator would be the number of conversions, and the denominator has to be some number that makes sense. Like in the example I just gave, web traffic was the denominator. For my grandpa, the number of leads he had could be the denominator, and the number of sales conversions could be the numerator. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_030.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine he went out one week and visited a hundred leads, and demonstrated his products. And 25 of them bought something, he could use his leads as his denominator for a conversion rate of 25%. That's pretty efficient. But what if he only visited 25 leads and all 25 bought something? That would be a conversion rate of 100% much more efficient. That's why you need rates. You need to see how efficient each method of getting conversions is. And `rates are an efficiency measure, you can compare across methods`. But for my grandpa is using leads in the denominator of the conversion rate accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_031.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not obvious what goes in the denominator of a conversion rate. Even in the example I just gave, it is possible that some of the web traffic to those stores would have been people not even looking to buy anything. So do they really belong in the denominator? `The denominator for conversion rates is always a conceptual problem`. Even for my grandpa, my dad loved the products from my grandpa's business, and would introduce his friends to the products and place orders together with them. My dad's friends, were never really leads in the traditional sense, because many of them never even met my grandpa. So as you can see from this brief example, even before the internet, exactly what goes in the denominator of a conversion rate, is a big question conceptually. And we face the same challenges in defining how to measure the denominator as we do when we think about measuring our conversions in the numerator. But please put your mind at ease. We will walk through all these issues in this course, so that you are empowered with the knowledge when it comes time for you to define the numerator and denominator for your conversion rates."

    "Now that we have the internet and social media, we have many kinds of conversions to think about.

Therefore, the types of conversions you study will depend on your marketing objectives. \n",

How the books are sold is that the publisher sells them to customers like distributors, or directly to individuals, and I get a royalty statement every six months. So, my desired action would be to have customers, distributors, and individuals purchase more books from the publisher. And I could measure this conversion, a record of the purchase of my book, by simply looking at the royalty statement. So, let's say I did a marketing campaign. I could look at that royalty statement, and see if the number of books I sold, or the number of conversions went up. My book hasn't been out very long, so I looked up the two royalty statements I have. In the first six month period, I sold 47 books. And in the second, I sold 44. So, I could really increase this number. And it's pretty clear where my baseline is. But let's be honest, I don't make much money, or have much fun, when I sell a book. What I really like to do is speak at data science conferences. I don't make any money when I do that, but I have a heck of a good time. So, I decided to make that my next marketing objective. I want to get more speaking gigs at data science conferences so, for my desired customer action, I need to somehow get people to invite me more often to speak at conferences. A record of an invite would be my conversion. \n",

    "In marketing courses, we learn about the concept of a `marketing funnel`. This is a concept of a funnel that can help you think about your marketing campaigns. At the top of the funnel are awareness related conversions, where a customer might learn about your brand or product, and may even engage in that conversion associated with your brand. Like, liking your brand on Facebook. You hope this will lead them down the conceptual funnel to the bottom, where there are sales conversions. In the `marketing funnel`, you are trying to funnel your customers down to a sale, or whatever conversion you pick. \n",

The conversion I'm considering is to raise my profile among the data science community. Here's the conversion I selected, having more customers know about me, and want me to actually speak at a conference. I believe that one way I can measure that conversion is to count the connections I get on LinkedIn whenever I post an article about data science. It's a great way to meet other data scientists actually. I could choose many different conversions to track, but my effort is limited. Therefore, I want to prioritize which conversions I track.

And my LinkedIn connections, how can I exactly tell if someone connected to me because of my post? My point is that `it might not be too hard to select priority conversions, but then, when you really get into the details, you realize there are operational challenges that you may not have even considered`.

Like how many new reviews I get on Amazon. And use that as a `proxy for a conversion`. The fact that I only get biannual reports limits my ability to measure my book sales in smaller time increments, and there are other limitations. If I'm using a conversion other than a sale, like a LinkedIn connection, what does that even mean? Maybe that connection really doesn't get me closer to a conversion like a conference invite, or book sale. And worse, you can measure the same conversions in different ways. \n",

If you do that, then you compare those metrics to what you see when you log into your actual Twitter account, you will see that the 2 counts don't exactly match. Twitter knows this and has explained it in their documentation. And if you use third party tweeting software, such as Buffer, you will find that it might count tweets differently than Twitter and Twitter analytics. So you have to think about which one you are going to choose to use for your experiment if you have Twitter related conversions. \n",

Just because they have that symptom? Or do they need laboratory confirmation of actually having the virus? In real life, we will set up a number of different `case definitions`, as we call them. One might be a symptom only definition, and one might be more strict, and require symptoms and laboratory confirmation. For each of these, we start out with a `working case definition`. Which is a list of criteria the patient must meet to qualify as a case, by definition. It is helpful to have real cases to guide us in developing these criteria.

Let's think of the natural time periods associated with these items. I said I get a royalty statement about my books and sell between 40 and 50 every six months. Let's think of what that would be per month, which is a smaller increment of time. Or per year which is a bigger one. With my speaking gigs I can get about one per year. So it's hard to really consider making that timeframe smaller than a year. But it could be bigger, but my views of my LinkedIn article, 134 views in about a week, well that could be a more flexible time window. Let's do a thought experiment. What if I benchmarked my book sale conversions, you know around 40 every six months by week. Or if I did my speaking gig conversions, which happened once per year if I am lucky, by the month. Or view of my LinkedIn articles by the hour. Right, you guessed it, I'm probably spreading my data too thin to get a good visualization. In other words, the time periods I'm selecting are so small for that conversion, I may have entire time periods with no conversions. When I make a graph of these time periods to visualize the data, I will have to make the graph report zero for the time periods with no conversions. \n",

But on the other hand, if we choose time increments that are so small, some of them have zero conversions, we are not able to see trends in the data. We saw this with the app example, where it was not helpful to see the data visualize daily compared to weekly because on some days we did not sell any apps. So you will have to try different time periods to figure out which is the best for visualizing trends in your data. And of course, the longer you have been collecting data and the more data you have, will give you flexibility in visualizing it."

Sales, blog views, mailing list signups, but let's run with this example so we can continue to get in the weeds with defining conversion rates and I can walk you through the logic. If unsuccessful with my LinkedIn articles, not only will my views go up, but certain behaviors of my viewers will go up, theoretically. Like likes and comments. Because you first have to view in order to like or comment. But all these numbers are just frequencies, like we say in statistics, otherwise we might call them counts, not rates. So, it is hard to figure out a goal or target for a count. Should I be doubling my views? What's wrong with setting a goal for 50 times the views? In other words, I really don't know what is realistic without a rate. I don't have a good feel for the numbers. \n",

    "Rates are way easier to use than just frequencies of conversions when trying to troubleshoot something over time. Or, to get back to the point, create an experiment to study increasing something. It's best to target increasing rates, not frequencies. But the numerator and denominator you pick for your conversion rate need to meet some conceptual requirements. First, the numerator is basically your frequency of conversions. Apply your case definitions, count up, and we've measured your numerator. Now here are the denominator rules. All the conversions in the numerator must also be in the denominator. In addition to those, we need to put everyone eligible to be a conversion, including those who did not convert, into the denominator with the converters. So what does that look like? Well, that's a philosophical question. Technically, anyone on the internet is eligible to view this public article I posted on LinkedIn, but most people are not even going to come to my LinkedIn page. So what's a reasonable proxy measurement? Maybe my number of followers on LinkedIn? Or my connections? \n",

    "Let's look at a spreadsheet to work this out. This spreadsheet is named Denominator Example and it's in your exercise files for this movie. See, I made up data about three LinkedIn data science articles I could have written. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_055.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the spreadsheet columns, I made up three imaginary articles, posted each a week apart. I count the data after one week to give the time for people to read and like the post. Now see these numbers? Number of followers and connections for each article on the day I did data collection? See how I made them go up as the date of publication of my articles advanced? They should go up if I'm doing a social media campaign to raise my data science profile. Now see these numbers about likes and shares of my articles. I deliberately made these numbers not change much. I wanted to show you what would happen in this scenario where I'm getting exposure to more followers and connections, but my article engagement is not going up. I want you to see how the number of followers or connections could be a denominator for views. Remember, that's our conversion. And also, just as an aside, we could use views as a denominator for comments, likes, and shares. Both situations seem to fit the eligible rule. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's click on the rates tab and see what these numbers look like as rates. You can look at this table above where I used Excel to calculate the rates using the numerator and denominators we talked about. This is our conversion rate, which is just the numerator divided by the denominator. But I will jump down here to the graphs. See this? Views by followers and views by connections are going down over time. This means that I'm getting new followers and connections, but they are not looking at my articles. Yet, as we can see in the second graph about comments, likes, and shares, people are engaging more. My comments, likes, and shares per views are going up, so this means my new audience is not looking at my articles, but my old audience is engaging more. This is not something I could have seen without the rates. \n",
