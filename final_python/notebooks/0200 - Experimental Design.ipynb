    "### Experiment is a type of study\n",
    "As you may already know, an experiment is a type of study. Whenever we choose to analyze data, whether it's data already in a database or data we collected ourselves, we always have to have some sort of study design behind it. An experiment is just one type of study design. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the features of experimental study designs, it's helpful to understand the other study designs first. I'm going to explain them to you using terminology from my field, which is public health. But please understand that the same study designs might be called something different in another field, such as psychology. But lucky for you, in every field, we all agree on what an experiment is. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_001.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In epidemiology, I find it helpful to think of the study designs not as equals but as a hierarchy, so I'm going to show you this helpful diagram I call the study design hierarchy. It starts at the top with human research, which is epidemiologists do, and if you are studying user behavior in your experiment, you will be researching humans as well. Let's start going down the hierarchy. Our first stop on the left side of the diagram is called `observational studies`. These are where we collect data about humans by simply recording what they do naturally. Perhaps I enroll a group of people who suffer migraines in a study, and ask them to record what medications they take when they get sick. If I do that, I'm just observing their behavior. This seems like a nice study design, right? Well, it is nice, but there are caveats. Let's move down the hierarchy from observational and you will see that it splits. On one side we have `descriptive studies`. Descriptive study designs do not test a hypothesis, but simply try to describe the data. You will learn more about this in this course actually because it is necessary to do some descriptive analysis as part of preparation for an experiment. Here, you will see the other way that observational studies split is called `analytic`. Those study designs are intended to test hypotheses. And trust me, they are really challenging. Remember, when you have a hypothesis, you are trying to figure out a cause, and in an analytic study, you are trying to test a hypothesis, but the data are very biased. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll give you some examples. I'm vegetarian and I also do yoga, and if you look in the world, you'll find a lot of people who are vegetarian and do yoga. Many video game fans are also comic books fans, and many history buffs like to both read about history and visit historical museums. So these observational biases, while interesting, can interfere with being able to tell what causes what in the data. So if I find out in my observational study that vegetarians are healthier than everyone else, is it because they are vegetarian, or because a lot of them do yoga? Or could it be caused by some other healthy behavior they do that we don't even know about? So we have this problem with being able to tell what caused what. This is where `experiment` comes in. Let's go back to the study design hierarchy. You will see I added experiment as a type of human research, opposite to observational studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_002.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In `experiment`, you are not simply observing what people are doing. You are actually controlling what they are doing. Well, only to some extent. There are boundaries and limitations. In fact, you will learn about those later in the course. But that basic idea that the researcher controls the choices, not the research participant, is the hallmark of an experiment. It is what makes an experiment different from an observational study. So, although we will do some descriptive analysis in this course to prepare for our experiment, the focus of this course will be on the specific steps to take when conducting a data science experiment."

    "### Features of an experiment\n",
    "Now we are going to look at specific features of experiments. This study design hierarchy diagram is one that I've shown you before. Just as a reminder, the experiment is counterpoised against or basically the opposite of an observational study. In an `observational study`, the researcher collects data about humans but does not assign them to do anything they would not normally do. In contrast, in an `experiment`, the researcher actually makes choices for the research participant and controls their choices in the study. So that is the first feature I want you to remember about experiments, and that is `in an experiment, the researcher makes choices for the participants`. Not the participant. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_003.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get into the details of what I mean by choices. Here is what the researcher assigns in an experiment, the conditions. Let's talk about the word conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_004.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In experimental research, the word `condition` roughly means the environment in which the study or research occurred. Think of a study testing a new uniform for army soldiers. One condition might be desert and one might be rainy. So another feature of an experiment is that `you need at least two conditions and the goal is to compare the conditions`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's sum what we have gone over so far as features of experiments, but let me put them in a slightly different way. We just talked about how experiments need to have at least two conditions, so you can compare them and tell which is better. Earlier, we talked about another feature of an experiment, which is that the researcher makes choices for the participants. Actually, the technical term for participants is experimental units, which means the type of entity on which you are doing your experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_005.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "`So the two features of experimental design we have talked about so far are that the experiment must have at least two comparable conditions and that the researcher must be the one to assign the participants to the conditions, not the participants themselves`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_006.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So why would you ever do an experiment? As I showed you earlier, you could just do an observational study. That way, you would not need any conditions and you would not need to assign anyone to them. But `experimental design is really what you need if you want to see if something new is better without completely converting over to the new way`. In an experiment, the old way can be one condition and the new way can be the other condition, and you can compare them. That way, you have the information to choose whether or not to convert to the new way or stay with the old way. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_006.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So up to now, experiments might sound like a pretty good deal but a lot of people do not appreciate how much work they are. Imagine an app developer who develops her app with a blue color scheme and wonders if users would respond more positively to a green color scheme. To do an experiment, she would basically have to build two versions of the app, one blue and one green. This would be a lot of work, especially if it was found at the end of the experiment that the blue-themed app was preferable. And it is also effort intensive and time consuming to keep all these assignments straight and to collect two different buckets of data, one for each condition. This is why you will find that observational studies are much more common than experiments. They are expensive and more work but on the other hand, experiments can be very valuable. Remember how I talked about all the bias involved in observational studies? That is what `all the effort in experiments is going towards, reducing the bias so you can see which condition is really better, the old way or the new way`. Experiments can provide uniquely valuable information that cannot be provided by other study designs. So under the right circumstances, the extra expense and time are worth it."

    "### Circumstances for experimental testing\n",
    "I'd like you to think about a thing you've studied over and over. I'm an epidemiologist, so I've studied a lot about certain diseases, but maybe you've studied your social media account over and over, trying to increase engagement. Or maybe you are a data analyst and have studied the behavior of your customers. Think about it, when you first encountered that topic, how did you study it? What study designs did you use? and didn't that lead to changes in the way you did things? Maybe you started using social media differently after seeing what posts or tweets work better than others. Or maybe you found parts of the database that were messy and cleaned them up. My point is that, if you do things right when studying the same thing over and over, you actually iterate in your study designs. You start by studying a problem, figuring out an `intervention` that you think would work to fix it, and applying it. If it doesn't work, you try something else. Which is a way of iterating. If it does work, that's great, but it means you can move on to `intervening` on another problem, and that's another way of iterating. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_008.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, what I mean by `intervention` is a change you make that intervenes on the system to make it run differently. One intervention you could do is fix a known problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've talked about how we can evolve and iterate through our study designs if we keep studying and working on the same topic over and over, I want to bring up the concept of `Scientific Equipoise`. It roughly `means scientifically equal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_009.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the concept we epidemiologists use to help us decide if we need to do an experiment. For example, to see what treatment works better for a certain disease. But since experiments are effort intensive and expensive, we want to choose wisely. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now just imagine I design this experiment. We want students to buy healthy food on a campus. So we give half of them a \\\\$20 gift card for healthy food and the other half we give \\\\$40 gift card and we want to see which group buys more food. Can you see what is wrong with this experiment? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, obviously, if you give someone \\\\$40 for free food and someone else \\\\$20 of free food, you can probably guess that the person given the $40 is going to go get more food. So these conditions are not at Scientific Equipoise. If you actually did an experiment like this it would be a waste of money because the two groups are not comparable. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_010.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how we could change the scenario to bring about Scientific Equipoise. Let's say we give both groups a \\\\$20 gift card but one group has to go to the cafeteria to redeem their card and get their food, and the other group can use an app to arrange for delivery of their \\\\$20 worth of food. Let's face it, we really don't know which one they would use more. In a colder climate, they may prefer the app. But in places where students like to meet in the cafeteria, they may prefer going out for food. \n",
    "\n",
    "`The point is, we really don't know which is better before we start the experiment`. When you really don't know at the beginning which group will be ahead at the end, then you have `Scientific Equipoise.` \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I want to return to talking about that thing you study all the time. Whatever it is. We are like the people on the slide. We feel the panic and the pain. We already know what the problems are. `Experiments are actually for when you run out of ideas on how to optimize your system`. Let's go back to the college students. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_011.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The college wants them to eat healthy food. There are a lot of things it could do to encourage this. Such as making healthy food cheap and available on campus. They don't need to do an experiment to surmise that this will help them optimize the part of their system that's trying to get college students to have good nutrition. Only after they do those things could they get any insight from the experiment I described earlier. If they don't first make sure there is healthy food available to the students, that experiment definitely will not work."

    "### When not to do an experiment\n",
    "I have a lot of customers coming to me wanting to do experiments at the wrong time. Maybe they just installed some new software at their workplace or they just upgraded their software or they just bought an additional location for their business. Or they just hired a volunteer coordinator. Whatever it is, let me just say, `when things are new, it's not necessary to do an experiment`. \n",

You are going to make some conditions, A and B, and they are going to be almost the same but different. `Condition A must be comparable to Condition B so B can only represent an incremental change from A`. But if you just did a new big thing, that's not an incremental change. That's a big change, and you did that for a reason, because you knew it would make things a whole lot better. That's why we upgrade software or hire volunteer coordinators or do whatever we do to make big changes in our business. We are being logical. Fixing big problems and preventing others. So the only way to realistically make changes to this hopefully new improved system is to have it settle down into a new normal before you start experimenting with incremental changes. \n",

    "It might be easier to illustrate with an example. I have this friend who works at this educational technology company. They offer online training for certification in some different occupations. So my friend told me that they recently upgraded their online application process to take their courses. They streamlined it so the application was easier to fill out. They were hoping they might get more customers that way as people had been complaining the application was too much trouble. So now that they had upgraded the application process, my friend wanted me to teach him how to design an experiment to determine what is the best format for the application process. Do you see any red flags with this request? They just recently upgraded because of complaints about the application process so they were aiming to fix these problems by doing the upgrade. Did the problems get fixed? We don't know yet. Since this place often has repeat customers, people who keep getting certified and re-certified, they have a lot of access to just talking to their customers. That's much more powerful than an experiment. \n",

Now they fixed it hopefully. `So what is the new normal? You need to know that before you design an experiment`. `The system has to be so stable that you can predict the metrics you want to change. That way you can create a reasonable B condition that might improve that metric`. My friend was thinking of the components of the business, the application, the customers paying, the customers taking courses but in experimentation, you have to think of the whole system as one thing. `You are experimenting on the whole system, so the system must be stable before you contemplate an experiment`. You need to be able to imagine a better way, a slight incremental change to the system. You need to have stable predictable metrics in your system that you can measure reliably. \n",

The customers who I tell need to do experiments are the ones that are exasperated. They have tried everything to make their system better and they just don't know what to do next. They are often exhausted and not in the mood for an experiment but that's the perfect time! So ironic.\n",

    "### Systems ready for experimental testing\n",
    "So, when should you do an experiment? Now I'm going to talk to you about the perfect situation in which to do an experiment. Remember, a test is going to be done on the entire system, so the entire system has to be ready for testing, like that case study of my friend at the education company. If they change the application process for their courses, it will change everything about their system, like how many sales they will ultimately expect. But what I didn't really mention is `not only do you need to have the business part of the system in order before you do an experiment, but you need the management part of the system to be in order as well`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_017.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's imagine that the `business part` is in good shape for an experiment. Maybe you are on a team that launched an app last year and you have a stable customer base and you have not really changed your app in awhile. That's a very predictable system, `you know what to expect with your metrics and your system's performance`. That's an ideal state of business for an experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you have to turn to `management` and `find out what their priorities are, what do they want to improve?` Usually this is framed in terms of metrics, like they want sales to go up, or to increase web traffic hits, or increase customer signups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my friend's example, he wanted to increase applications to his online courses. So that's the first thing managers need to talk about with respect to the experiment. What are we trying to change exactly? Now you need management to get creative with you because `in each A/B experiment you can test only one change`. Remember how I said you can only choose one B condition to test per experiment, so you need to choose wisely? These managers can help you brainstorm what might be a good change to test. So have them help you prioritize. What is a top barrier we can remove to sales, or whatever metric is important? Or maybe a slight redesign of the app will increase sales. In fact, whatever your role in the organization, your experiment is the most useful if you actually interview management who are in the know about the challenges they are prioritizing and the metrics they really want to change. If you ask them directly, you can get great information around which to design your experiment. The take home message is that `you are really going to have to get management on board for any experiment to work`. Even if you are really smart yourself, if you don't have management there on your side, you will miss important perspectives. Management is what really knows all parts of the system and they need to okay changes to the system because they have a better idea of how those changes will impact the system. `They will need to help you be creative in designing the B condition because you will need them to commit to adopting the condition that wins in the experiment, either A or B`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_018.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if your system is in good shape for an experiment, you have to also ask yourself, is management on board and in it for the long haul? Because if they are not, then the experiment won't work. The experiment itself is problematic, it's time consuming, expensive, and often disruptive to different departments. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_019.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But imagine you've found a way to increase sales a lot by just a little change. That's why experiments can be worth the trouble, but only if management is really committed to it. If they are not, the experiment will likely be disrupted and you won't get a good read on the result. Or you'll get the result and management won't implement it. You really need to make sure management is in it for the long haul before embarking on an experiment."

    "The really picky thing in experiments is setting up the conditions. Imagine that the blue star on the left represents condition A which might be how you are doing things now. You will have to make one minor change to condition A to invent a condition B and then see which one works better. \n",

In another, I kept the star blue and put a yellow dot on it. In the third, I kept the star blue, but just made it a little bigger. This visual demonstrates making one little change to condition A. The thing is, to represent condition B, I only made one change to the star, like I did not change the color and the size at the same time for condition B. `In AB testing, you can only make one change from condition A to condition B. So, basically you can only choose one condition B for the whole experiment`. So, that actually becomes the difficult thing, choosing what the exact change you are going to make to condition A to test as conditioned B. Because the idea is if you find condition B is better, then you will want to throw away A and start using B. \n",
    "\n",
    "`And you'd be surprised that I run into this common problem when coaching people on experimental design.

Aha, I made you realize why we are not using the imagined conditioned B of the \\\\$90 purse right now, because then our business of selling purses would lose money. We'd lose \\\\$10 per purse. That's why we are charging \\\\$100 in the first place. So, `the conditions must represent an equal trade-off`. I assume if you are selling purses, you have already set the price that you need to have in order to break even in your business.

    "`The goal of an experiment is typically to figure out the best way to maximize conversions`. But let's stop and think about the word conversion for a moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I was a little girl, my grandfather sold some boutique health products. He didn't have many customers, mostly family and friends. But when we go to his sales meetings, they would talk about making a list of leads or potential customers. And then going to visit the leads and demonstrate the product. If the lead bought the product, they would convert to a customer. So a conversion was basically a customer buying something, a sale and that's pretty easy to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_026.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward, now I'm an adult, and we have the internet. The internet is interesting, because when you buy something on the internet, you usually do all this pre sales behavior. Looking at products, maybe joining a mailing list, or liking a social media post. These are all conversions, but not like my grandfather would think about them. This means there are more options for different types of conversions with social media and the internet. So things got more interesting, but also more complicated. Now there were more marketing channels. And because we could capture data along the way of the customer's journey, we could optimize how we use these channels to get to the customer. So while we have an opportunity to do a really good job of marketing now, which we did not have before, we also have more decisions to make and more to think about. It definitely got more complicated than when my grandpa was selling his health products. So the goal of an experiment, should be to figure out the best way to get conversions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you should have readied to your system, and have it be in condition A. Which is the condition that represents your best attempt at getting all the types of conversions you want out of your website, social media effort or whatever you are doing that you want conversions. Of course, you may be trying to get different types of conversions with one campaign, maybe increase your blog readers, increase your emailing list and also get sales.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_027.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "`The main advantage of an experiment, is that you can take a system that is an optimal shape like you think it is getting the most conversions you can, and test one little change and see if it actually increases conversions`. It's a good way to get guidance on whether you should actually make that change. Remember, a change could increase some kinds of conversions and decrease others. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you try to rebrand your website to appeal to a younger audience, your brand may attract more social media followers, since social media is dominated by younger people, but you might have lower sales, as younger people tend to have less disposable income than older people. Therefore, you want to be fully informed on what the impact will be of the change. And an experiment can do that for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are really going to hang our hat on these conversions, we really need to know what we are talking about. We might have multiple kinds of conversions as I said, and we might even care about specific types of conversions, like selling a particular item, rather than just making a sale. This means we have to count conversions. So we have to get in the business of doing a good job of counting. And to do that, you have to define exactly what you are counting. And more importantly, you have to make sure what you are counting is important. \n",

    "\n",
    "But imagine we had to compare conversions. Let's say we had two different online stores selling the same products. They were just branded differently. If we had 100 sales conversions at both online stores, without knowing what the traffic is at the stores, that number would not mean much. Let's say one store gets a thousand hits a day, and the other gets a million hits a day. The fact that they both have a hundred conversions, does not tell the whole story. We don't want to compare conversions. Instead we want to be able to make a rate, which is a fraction with a numerator and a denominator and compare rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_029.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator would be the number of conversions, and the denominator has to be some number that makes sense. Like in the example I just gave, web traffic was the denominator. For my grandpa, the number of leads he had could be the denominator, and the number of sales conversions could be the numerator. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_030.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine he went out one week and visited a hundred leads, and demonstrated his products. And 25 of them bought something, he could use his leads as his denominator for a conversion rate of 25%. That's pretty efficient. But what if he only visited 25 leads and all 25 bought something? That would be a conversion rate of 100% much more efficient. That's why you need rates. You need to see how efficient each method of getting conversions is. And `rates are an efficiency measure, you can compare across methods`. But for my grandpa is using leads in the denominator of the conversion rate accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_031.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not obvious what goes in the denominator of a conversion rate. Even in the example I just gave, it is possible that some of the web traffic to those stores would have been people not even looking to buy anything. So do they really belong in the denominator? `The denominator for conversion rates is always a conceptual problem`. Even for my grandpa, my dad loved the products from my grandpa's business, and would introduce his friends to the products and place orders together with them. My dad's friends, were never really leads in the traditional sense, because many of them never even met my grandpa. So as you can see from this brief example, even before the internet, exactly what goes in the denominator of a conversion rate, is a big question conceptually. And we face the same challenges in defining how to measure the denominator as we do when we think about measuring our conversions in the numerator. But please put your mind at ease. We will walk through all these issues in this course, so that you are empowered with the knowledge when it comes time for you to define the numerator and denominator for your conversion rates."

    "Now that we have the internet and social media, we have many kinds of conversions to think about.

Therefore, the types of conversions you study will depend on your marketing objectives. \n",

How the books are sold is that the publisher sells them to customers like distributors, or directly to individuals, and I get a royalty statement every six months. So, my desired action would be to have customers, distributors, and individuals purchase more books from the publisher. And I could measure this conversion, a record of the purchase of my book, by simply looking at the royalty statement. So, let's say I did a marketing campaign. I could look at that royalty statement, and see if the number of books I sold, or the number of conversions went up. My book hasn't been out very long, so I looked up the two royalty statements I have. In the first six month period, I sold 47 books. And in the second, I sold 44. So, I could really increase this number. And it's pretty clear where my baseline is. But let's be honest, I don't make much money, or have much fun, when I sell a book. What I really like to do is speak at data science conferences. I don't make any money when I do that, but I have a heck of a good time. So, I decided to make that my next marketing objective. I want to get more speaking gigs at data science conferences so, for my desired customer action, I need to somehow get people to invite me more often to speak at conferences.

    "In marketing courses, we learn about the concept of a `marketing funnel`. This is a concept of a funnel that can help you think about your marketing campaigns. At the top of the funnel are awareness related conversions, where a customer might learn about your brand or product, and may even engage in that conversion associated with your brand. Like, liking your brand on Facebook. You hope this will lead them down the conceptual funnel to the bottom, where there are sales conversions. In the `marketing funnel`, you are trying to funnel your customers down to a sale, or whatever conversion you pick. \n",

The conversion I'm considering is to raise my profile among the data science community. Here's the conversion I selected, having more customers know about me, and want me to actually speak at a conference. I believe that one way I can measure that conversion is to count the connections I get on LinkedIn whenever I post an article about data science. It's a great way to meet other data scientists actually. I could choose many different conversions to track, but my effort is limited. Therefore, I want to prioritize which conversions I track.

And my LinkedIn connections, how can I exactly tell if someone connected to me because of my post? My point is that `it might not be too hard to select priority conversions, but then, when you really get into the details, you realize there are operational challenges that you may not have even considered`.

Like how many new reviews I get on Amazon. And use that as a `proxy for a conversion`. The fact that I only get biannual reports limits my ability to measure my book sales in smaller time increments, and there are other limitations. If I'm using a conversion other than a sale, like a LinkedIn connection, what does that even mean? Maybe that connection really doesn't get me closer to a conversion like a conference invite, or book sale. And worse, you can measure the same conversions in different ways. \n",

If you do that, then you compare those metrics to what you see when you log into your actual Twitter account, you will see that the 2 counts don't exactly match. Twitter knows this and has explained it in their documentation. And if you use third party tweeting software, such as Buffer, you will find that it might count tweets differently than Twitter and Twitter analytics.

Just because they have that symptom? Or do they need laboratory confirmation of actually having the virus? In real life, we will set up a number of different `case definitions`, as we call them. One might be a symptom only definition, and one might be more strict, and require symptoms and laboratory confirmation. For each of these, we start out with a `working case definition`. Which is a list of criteria the patient must meet to qualify as a case, by definition. It is helpful to have real cases to guide us in developing these criteria.

Let's think of the natural time periods associated with these items. I said I get a royalty statement about my books and sell between 40 and 50 every six months. Let's think of what that would be per month, which is a smaller increment of time. Or per year which is a bigger one. With my speaking gigs I can get about one per year. So it's hard to really consider making that timeframe smaller than a year. But it could be bigger, but my views of my LinkedIn article, 134 views in about a week, well that could be a more flexible time window. Let's do a thought experiment. What if I benchmarked my book sale conversions, you know around 40 every six months by week. Or if I did my speaking gig conversions, which happened once per year if I am lucky, by the month. Or view of my LinkedIn articles by the hour. Right, you guessed it, I'm probably spreading my data too thin to get a good visualization. In other words, the time periods I'm selecting are so small for that conversion, I may have entire time periods with no conversions. When I make a graph of these time periods to visualize the data, I will have to make the graph report zero for the time periods with no conversions. \n",

But on the other hand, if we choose time increments that are so small, some of them have zero conversions, we are not able to see trends in the data. We saw this with the app example, where it was not helpful to see the data visualize daily compared to weekly because on some days we did not sell any apps. So you will have to try different time periods to figure out which is the best for visualizing trends in your data. And of course, the longer you have been collecting data and the more data you have, will give you flexibility in visualizing it."

    "Now we will talk about conversions in the context of calculating conversion rates. So, just to remind everyone, a `conversion rate has a numerator and a denominator`. And whatever the conversion we pick, in the case of social media, that could be likes, comments, shares, views, whatever, that's going to be the numerator in that rate. \n",

    "\n",
    "So, the question we ask often in my field of epidemiology, as well as in business, what's the right denominator for our rate? I realize there are many types of conversions out there. Sales, blog views, mailing list signups, but let's run with this example so we can continue to get in the weeds with defining conversion rates and I can walk you through the logic. If unsuccessful with my LinkedIn articles, not only will my views go up, but certain behaviors of my viewers will go up, theoretically. Like likes and comments. Because you first have to view in order to like or comment. But all these numbers are just frequencies, like we say in statistics, otherwise we might call them counts, not rates. So, it is hard to figure out a goal or target for a count. Should I be doubling my views? What's wrong with setting a goal for 50 times the views? In other words, I really don't know what is realistic without a rate. I don't have a good feel for the numbers. \n",

    "Rates are way easier to use than just frequencies of conversions when trying to troubleshoot something over time. Or, to get back to the point, create an experiment to study increasing something. It's best to target increasing rates, not frequencies. But the numerator and denominator you pick for your conversion rate need to meet some conceptual requirements. First, the numerator is basically your frequency of conversions. Apply your case definitions, count up, and we've measured your numerator. Now here are the denominator rules. All the conversions in the numerator must also be in the denominator. In addition to those, we need to put everyone eligible to be a conversion, including those who did not convert, into the denominator with the converters. So what does that look like? Well, that's a philosophical question. Technically, anyone on the internet is eligible to view this public article I posted on LinkedIn, but most people are not even going to come to my LinkedIn page. So what's a reasonable proxy measurement? Maybe my number of followers on LinkedIn? Or my connections? \n",

    "For the spreadsheet columns, I made up three imaginary articles, posted each a week apart. I count the data after one week to give the time for people to read and like the post. Now see these numbers? Number of followers and connections for each article on the day I did data collection? See how I made them go up as the date of publication of my articles advanced? They should go up if I'm doing a social media campaign to raise my data science profile. Now see these numbers about likes and shares of my articles. I deliberately made these numbers not change much. I wanted to show you what would happen in this scenario where I'm getting exposure to more followers and connections, but my article engagement is not going up. I want you to see how the number of followers or connections could be a denominator for views. Remember, that's our conversion. And also, just as an aside, we could use views as a denominator for comments, likes, and shares. Both situations seem to fit the eligible rule. \n",

You can look at this table above where I used Excel to calculate the rates using the numerator and denominators we talked about. This is our conversion rate, which is just the numerator divided by the denominator. But I will jump down here to the graphs. See this? Views by followers and views by connections are going down over time. This means that I'm getting new followers and connections, but they are not looking at my articles. Yet, as we can see in the second graph about comments, likes, and shares, people are engaging more. My comments, likes, and shares per views are going up, so this means my new audience is not looking at my articles, but my old audience is engaging more. This is not something I could have seen without the rates. \n",

    "Now that we have identified and prioritized our conversions, we will operationalize counting them.

    "\n",
    "Let's get into the details. Let's start with payment. That is pretty straight forward. I would receive a payment in our payment software app and count it. There, that is a conversion. But what if I get a payment from someone who did not even use the module, they just wanted the certificate? Trust me, students act in all different ways. You cannot predict what they will do. Should I count it when they pay but haven't actually used the module? Or, better yet, can I classify my payments as coming from people who were super engaged versus those who were not engaged? Wouldn't that be more meaningful? Depending upon how web savvy you are, your answer might be different. Personally, I cannot sort out the payments easily between the super-engaged users and non-engaged ones. But a really good web programmer and marketer probably could. But if you pay, you at least had to do that. You had to engage that much, so I will consider paying as a `proxy measurement for engagement in this module` even though I feel a little iffy about that. \n",

What if they are just my friend who found the module completion page and not someone who actually completed the module? So to operationalize this, let's just go back to basics. For whatever reason, the user went through the work of sending this tweet, logging into Twitter, and owning this little message linking their account to this web page and my Twitter account. They liked whatever I have up on the page enough to promote it for free for me. So I will say that this is a good `proxy for liking my module so much that they want to promote it`. \n",

    "And my third goal, which was engagement. Because there is so much multi-media on all these pages, I can measure so many things. But my experience from teaching college courses online is that students who download the materials are the most engaged students and often do better in the course. So let's say I just keep track of how many times someone downloads the slides from the module completion page? We acknowledge up front that it would be an under count of how many people really engage with the module, but you could see it as a `sentinel event`. Let me define that for you. Again, to define Sentinel Events, I'm going to bring up my field of epidemiology where we have this concept of sentinel events, or events that give you a signal or notification of something that might be bigger than the actual signal. The signal itself is smaller but proportional to the bigger thing, so when the signal gets bigger you know that the thing it represents also gets bigger. Here's an example of how we use the term Sentinel Events in epidemiology. Imagine there is a situation at a restaurant or event where the food is contaminated and it results in cases of food poisoning. Some of the people who get sick, but certainly not all of them, will file a report with the local health department. The health department knows there are way more people sickened who do not report it, but they also know that if the reports go up sharply, it might be the sign of an outbreak. So, I'm going to handle the downloading of slides like a sentinel event. I will assume it is `proportional to how many people are very engaged in the module`. There may be few people, but if that number goes up, it means that engagement in general has increased.\n",

But, for now, you will see that I put the name of the conversion rate in the first column. I called it name. It's more of a humanly understandable description. Let's go over the names of the three pay conversions I listed. Rate of paid users who deeply engaged in the module is a concept and is conceptually different from rate of paid users who completed the module, but as you can tell from the rest of this tab, the only thing we can count for the conversion numerator is the number of the payments from the payment software. You can see that in the next column titled numerator meaning, where this idea is reflected, so these differing concepts, rate of deeply engaged users to pay versus rate of just completers to pay, they will have to be reflected in choices of denominator, which we will do later. I want you to see what I'm capturing here in these columns titled how numerator operationalized and measure numerator from where. We are specifying how we are counting and the source of where we are counting the numerator. Our payment software seems like an obvious place. That's where the sales conversions happen, but theoretically, we could count something else, like how often the user clicks on the pay button on the webpage, so you need to write down how exactly you plan to count these conversions later. \n",

    "Let's look at our next tab, word of mouth. This is going to be similar to the pay conversion. You can see it has the same columns. This time our numerator is how many times users click on the Click to Tweet control and tell everyone on Twitter about the module. That's repeated in the numerator meaning column. Again, there is one way I operationalize this. I decided to count the actual tweets that are sent. They're our structured tweets, so I could even download all the tweets from the company Twitter account and sort it out programatically, or count manually, since I don't expect a high amount of traffic. So I recorded this in the how numerator operationalized column. This is different than counting the clicks of the tweet button on the page from Google Analytics, so I want to keep track of how I decided to keep count, and you see under the name column, I have three conceptual conversion rates, deep engagers who tweeted, completers who tweeted, and just users who tweeted. How well I do at measuring these rates will rely on what I pick for the denominator and that will be limited by what I can measure. \n",

Remember, we decided there were so many different types of engagement we could measure, that we would just measure the sentinel event of a user downloading the slides on the module completion page. The numerator meaning is that they downloaded the slides and we operationalize as counting how many people downloaded the slides from the completion page. I actually checked and found that I could get that metric from Google Analytics. This conversion is straightforward with one row on the spreadsheet.

So they decided that when they released their new camera, they will again do another social media campaign like the one in 2015. Of course, a campaign like that will likely also increase their sales of their classic camera, which has been around for several years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we wanted to study the impact of their new social media campaign, on sales of the classic camera. To see if this campaign impacts the sales of classic cameras, we'd need to track conversions. Which would be number of classic cameras sold.

    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_073.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator would obviously be number of cameras sold, and you'd have to have a defined time period in which to estimate both the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is somewhat obvious, but the denominator is not. Who is eligible to buy a classic camera from GoPro? We might say that anyone who can access GoPro's web store, answers the question as to who is eligible to buy a classic camera from GoPro. But I'm sure they also have a customer service phone line, a person could call and use to order a camera. Also, what if I go to the web store to look up information about GoPro for this video, and I really don't have the money to buy a camera after all. I'm sure there are people accessing the web store with no intention of buying a camera. How about something more specific? Like people who actually bought something in GoPro's web store? They might have bought a classic camera, but they could have bought a new camera or something else they sell. This would narrow down the number a bit. So maybe the smaller more focused denominator is better to use. Selecting an invalid denominator can mess up your conversion rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_074.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "And while you probably can't be perfect, you want to try to select valid denominators. Ask yourself, are all the conversions in the numerator also in the denominator? If you bought a classic camera at GoPro's web store, are you someone who bought something at GoPro's web store? The answer is yes. But if you just visited their web store, with no intention of buying and we are counting it in the denominator, the denominator might not be as valid. Obviously, the number of people who visit the web store, is way huger than the number of people who actually purchase something at the web store. So `the denominator selection can greatly impact the size of the conversion rates`. \n",

    "Let's think in more detail about denominators for a moment. Imagine you have a big denominator, like number of people visiting GoPro's online store. Your rate is going to be lower because compared to the number of people visiting the store online, the number of sales of the classic camera are going to be very low. Also, you'll get challenges to validity. Like maybe not everyone who went to the web store, was actually shopping for a camera. But the rate will be more stable over time. In other words, during the social media campaign for the new camera, even if you double the conversions for the classic camera in the numerator, if you have a huge denominator from all the web store visits, it doesn't impact the resulting rate much. \n",

If we continued to include that customer in our `numerator`, it would be a `false positive conversion`. Also, imagine someone actually called on the phone to the company, in order to GoPro without using the web store. That conversion will not show up in our `numerator`. So that would be a `false negative`. We tried to measure the numerator right and do our best, but sometimes there is slippage. We can live with a little of that random error. \n",

    "But with our `denominator`, the problem of false positives and negatives can be magnified. For `false positives` imagine we keep customers, who bought something but returned it in the denominator. So they really didn't buy anything, but they are still in the denominator. We are watering down the denominator with people who are not eligible to be in the numerator. And what happens if we get `false negatives`? In this scenario, what if we miscounting all the sales that happen outside the web store in the `denominator`? Then they will be missing from the denominator and we'll make it artificially smaller. In epidemiology, we call this mis-classification. \n",

If we categorize a conversion as not a conversion, then we are doing mis-classification. `Mis-classification is a bad thing, because it can impact rates. Whether it's mis-classification of what to count or not count in the numerator or misclassifications of what to count or not count in the denominator`. Now, you will understand why I am encouraging you to craft a few different conversion rates per metric. You want to play with some different denominators, because mis-classification can really impact rates."

Maybe there's a little misclassification, like maybe a sale gets returned but accidentally is counted as a sale, but it's not going to be big, where you can end up inducing false positives and negatives is with your selection of the denominator. Actually, you can screw up so badly that you can select a denominator that causes false negatives or positives in both the numerator and the denominator. `Remember the rule that everyone in the numerator has to also be in the denominator`. If you mess that up, then you end up with misclassifying the numerator. So what do you do? The solution is to have a few of them. That way you can shop around. Let's look at an example. \n",

    "This spreadsheet is in your exercise files for this movie and it's called false positives and negatives in the denominator. This looks like documentation of numerators and denominators. Let's look at what we have here. We have columns named metric, definition, issues, and then we have columns named after months, January through June. On the first row under metric, we list our conversion or numerator. This is from our GoPro example that was talked about in the article in the magazine \"Entrepreneur.\" GoPro produces multiple cameras, and though it had a classic camera that sold well, they were talking in the article about doing a social media campaign to promote the release of their new cameras. We wanted to pretend to track the sales of the classic camera in GoPro's website is conversions during the social media campaign for the new camera. So we wrote down the number of classic cameras sold online as the definition, and under issues, we record that we can't tell which sales of the classic camera we're influenced by the social media campaign, but that's fine, and seeing next to it under the month's columns, I made up some fake data for you. Let's look at the conversions row. I pretended the campaign started in January and the classic camera sold just kept going up. I entered small numbers, 50, 60, 70 just to make a point. I'm sure in real life they sold more. Now see what I did with the other rows so we can shop around for denominators. See these three rows, I made up three different denominators. Then see these three rows down here after those rows, those are the three rates I get when I pair the conversion numerator with each denominator. Now let's look at the rows for the denominators I made up for us. Let's look at the first one. Since this is a Web Store, we could use the denominator of sales transactions. We know classic camera sales, the numerator were all sales transactions, so this doesn't violate the rule, but I did put down the issue that you can have multiple things in a transaction. Like some transactions have more products than others and cost different amounts overall. They are not all equal, but let's say we accept that. See how this narrow definition of the denominator makes it small. I made the denominator be 100. Let's look at the corresponding rate. See these rates? 50%, 60%, 70%, I know this is fake data, but these are big percentages, so let's say before the campaign, the rate of buying classic cameras per transaction was 50%. By using this denominator during the campaign, if the classic camera transactions increased, you could see it go up. Let's see what happens when we pick another denominator. Let's look at the second one I picked out for us. The second one I picked is the number of online visits to the Web Store. This is going to be a much bigger number, but is it accurate? It assumes that everyone who went to the Web Store was actually shopping for a camera. What if someone went there just to learn about cameras and had no intention of buying one? In any case, our assumption may not be accurate, but it's good enough for a second denominator, but then let's look at the resulting counts. See how they go up by an order of magnitude from 100 to 1000, you can tell this is fake data, but I'm making this simulation to show you what happens when you blow up the denominator even when it makes things more accurate. Let's look down here at what happens to the corresponding rate. See here, now the rates are very small. What does that mean? You have more space to improve. See how in June a 100% of the transactions had classic cameras. You can't go up from there, but if only 10% of the customers are buying classic cameras, see the second rate in June, you can go up from there. Let's try on one more denominator for size. Here is a really sketchy denominator. It's estimating how many people were reached by the entire ad campaign, which was on different social media. Advertising companies have to estimate this, and they do have a way of doing it, but how can we tell everyone who bought a classic camera was reached by the campaign? We may have what's called ecologic fallacy where we assume the people who saw the campaign overlap with the people who bought the classic camera online, and that might be a false assumption. As you can see, using this definition makes our denominator so big that our rate gets small enough for me to have to set it up as rate per 1000. In epidemiology, we avoid saying 0.1%, we just multiply it by the order of magnitude needed to get a whole number on the other side of the decimal. So we'll say then one per 1000. Now you know the pros and cons of choosing different denominators. So make sure you choose wisely."

    "### Document denominators\n",
    "Now, let's return to our example scenario, and document the denominators we are going to use on our conversion rates in our experiment. In an earlier section, we talked about our scenario. We developed three conversions we wanted to track. The customer paying, the customer downloading material, and the customer tweeting out, a canned marketing word-of-mouth tweet on our web page. We operationalized and documented those conversions, which are our numerators, and we were comfortable counting those. But, remember, the reason why I'm calling the conversion a numerator is because we are trying to make a conversion rate, which means we need a denominator. And, as I showed you in the previous sections with the GoPro example, `what you choose as your denominator can really impact not only the magnitude of your rate, but how accurate it is`. So, this is why it's tempting to `choose more than one denominator, so you just make more than one rate, that way you can get a feel for the situation using multiple rates`. But you don't want to go overboard and have too many rates that aren't helpful. Let's go look at the spreadsheet I made as an example. This is your exercise file with this section. I'm on the second tab that says, Pay. \n",

They are all about the numerator. We saw these in an earlier section. But see here, columns F through I on the spreadsheet, these are new, they are about the denominator. The meaning, how it is operationalized and where to measure it from? I also have a comments column at the end. I've got three different potential denominators. \n",
    "- The first one has the meaning that the user completed the module, if I did that rate with that denominator they paid over, they completed the module how would I measure the denominator? Well, I could say whoever bothered to do the sentinel event of downloading the slides, probably, completed the module. But I decided against that one. First, a user might download the slides and not pay that would violate one of the rules, the one about all conversions being in the denominator. Let's look at the next line. \n",
    "- This next potential denominator is that they watched the final video. Specifically, they watched at least 25% of it. I realized when I looked in YouTube Analytics on my channel that I could tell the number of people who watched at least 25% of my video. They really track a lot of detail in YouTube Analytics. I like this denominator because, not only can I measure it, I feel pretty confident that if the person paid they watched at least 25% of the video. Less of a violation of that rule than the last denominator we talked about. But, of course, it is possible they paid and did not watch. I just think it is unlikely. You'll see under the comment column, though, that I note that it may be hard to increase this rate. This is kind of like the rate that people are willing to pay for using something for free. But, I could increase the absolute numbers of both the numerator and the denominator. You can see in this first column, called Code, that I shopped for another denominator in the third row, but I chose really to track only one, this middle one, so, I gave it an award, I made it blue and also I gave it a code name, PAY1. Let's look at the other tabs. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's click on the tab WOM, this is the tab for the word-of-mouth conversion. And this also has three rates on it. All of these numerators where users sent the marketing tweet but all three denominators are blue on this page and all three have a code. See, WOM1, WOM2, and WOM3. So, I really went on a shopping spree with denominators here, let's see what I bought. See, all these denominators are trying to express the measurement of the same concept, that the user completed the module. One has downloaded the slides, one has watched at least 25% of the video, and the last is they just visited the module completion page Where you can really see the difference is in the measurement column. In the first, I chose to measure that they downloaded the slides. I measured YouTube Analytics and Google Analytics before as places to get numbers. For the numerator, I decided it would be unlikely they would tweet unless they finished the module. And it would be unlikely they would complete the survey unless they finished the module. But maybe I'm wrong, there are people who just compulsively tweet in the world. I wrote these thoughts down in the comments column. I want us to look at the last line with the last denominator, which is that the user actually visited the module completion page. Both you and I know that users could find themselves here and not have completed the module at all. But, as you can see in my comment on the spreadsheet, if you use web-based AB testing this would be your denominator. So, if I made two different module completion pages, let's say one that was blue and one that was red, and I wanted to see which color made users want to tweet more I'd be stuck using the number of visitors to the page as the denominator in the conversion by design. So, I collected that here. You can go on and look at the third tab on how I operationalized engagement and documented denominators. But, now, we have done enough design and operationalized, and documented our conversion rates, both the numerators and the denominators."

    "### Determine time frames\n",
    "The last topic I'm going to cover with respect to conversion rates, is setting time frames for calculating the rates. In earlier sections, I showed you some data I made up about conversion frequencies. You know, the numerator of a conversion rate. Remember these charts of those data where I graphed the conversions aggregated by day, and compared them to how it looks when I graph the same conversions aggregated by week? I pretended these conversions came from online app sales.\n",

    "So when we look at the data as a daily graph, it's all jagged because some of the days we don't sell any apps at all and some days, we sell as many as five. So just because that's the way our data behave, it's much easier to see a trend if we batch them up and graph them by week. Like the other graph I made of the same data. In the weekly graph, it's easier to see a trend. Just from eyeballing it, you could even guess an average amount of sales per week. My guess would be eight apps per week. But it's hard to even guess an average from the daily graph. \n",

    "I went over all those ideas about numerator frequencies with you back before I brought up the whole denominator thing. And how we need denominators so we can make rates and compare them over time. So the question is, \"How do the denominators impact how we pick our time frame for our conversion rates?\" I'll walk you through the thinking. Usually denominators do not change much from time period to time period. Imagine you have a thousand followers on Twitter and you tweet this and tweet that and then you tweet a link and someone clicks on it. If you're number of followers is your denominator and the clicks are the numerator, you know your number of followers is going to be pretty constant. It may go up slowly but also people might unfollow you. It's going to be a pretty stable number unless you do some sort of marketing campaign to increase followers. \n",

    "Remember the GoPro campaign I talked about earlier where the multiple camera maker was planning to do a social media campaign to promote the release of their new camera? So we hypothesize this campaign could increase sales of their classic camera as well. So that would increase the numerator of their classic camera purchase conversion rate. But since their campaign is about a new product, they will probably attract a lot of brand new customers too. So if customers were their denominator and classic camera sales were their numerator, probably both their numerator and their denominator would go up in response to their campaign. So denominators are pretty stable. And the main reason they might change quickly is due to a marketing campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_088.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But no matter what, the take home message is that the numerator, not the denominator, is what you use to determine time frames for your conversion rates. And we can illustrate this principle with some logic. \n",

    "Let's revisit this zig-zaggy daily conversion plot we looked at earlier. These are daily conversions which I'm pretending are daily sales of an app. Imagine we had a denominator of 100 per day, like 100 visits to the page that sells the app. Even if we put a denominator under each of these points, day four would still be a conversion rate of 0 because there would be no sales that day no matter what. And if for some reason more people were visiting the app's sales page, like it doubled and increased to 200, we'd have to double our sales in order to keep up the conversion rate. But double 0 is 0. So day four would still be 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_090.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But now look what happens when I take the same data and graph it weekly as we saw in a previous video. And let's do the same thing by imagining a denominator. Remember how we imagined 100 per day? That's the same as 700 per week. So that's our imaginary denominator now. See week seven? We had 12 conversions that week. So that week's rate would be 12 divided by 700 which is pretty small. Even as a percentage, it is like 1.71%. Very small. Because of this, I like to express it in a different way. Instead of a weekly conversion rate of 1.71%, I would say say it was 17 per 1,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/exp_design_091.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "I like whole numbers. That way, if you double your conversion rate from 17 per 1,000 to 34 per 1,000, it's easy to talk about and envision. So while we have discovered that the optimal time frame for these data, for conversion rates, is weekly, we found the actual rate expressed as a percentage is so small, it is rather unintuitive. In that situation, we will keep the optimal time frame and just find a more communicative way of expressing the rate. So you have probably guessed by now that `when you do an experiment, whether it's on a webpage or on people or animals, you really have to do a lot of background research in order to design a good experiment`. These data were simulated baseline data in an example. But in real life, `you'd have to gather baseline data about your conversion rates`. And it's nice to track them over a few time periods to get a feel for their behavior over time. Then you could use that information to predict what might happen if you did an intervention intended to increase conversions, like a marketing campaign. In my imaginary scenario, these graphs of baseline data could help me set a reasonable goal if I am contemplating embarking on a marketing campaign.\n",

It is true that dashboards like the ones offered by Google Analytics and Twitter Analytics provide you with data, and you can set filters, save reports, and even export data. Even though you have that flexibility, you have to know what you are doing and what exact data you need. Let's say you designed some rates and now you want to graph them. You know how you will count them. You put that on your planning sheet. But literally, what filters do you set? Or what reports do you look at? Or what data do you export to get the aggregated numerators and denominators you need by the time period you selected? Remember that's what was in the data I visualized earlier when I showed you the time series charts. \n",

    "Now that we've gone over, our baseline results, I'm going to show you how to use them as a guide for designing the other condition in your experiment. Continuing with our example scenario of the Click to Tweet conversion, on the completion page of an online management learning module, we are going to focus on WOM3 rate in our experiment because we want to use page views as the denominator and the number of times the tweet was sent from the Click to Tweet control on the page as the numerator. \n",

    "\n",
    "So say I do some sort of campaign which makes more users land on that page thus increasing my denominator. If they continue to click the Click to Tweet control at the same rate as they did when there were fewer views, my views will not go up and my clicks will go up but my rate will not. So in the case of this scenario, the goal is not only to just increase views, that's increasing the denominator. Increasing views will likely also increase the numerator but only proportionally which does not succeed, in increasing the overall conversion rate. To be successful, we have to increase the numerator relative to the denominator. To help me figure out how to increase conversions relative to views for the WOM3 rate, I made this application flow diagram for the WOM3 rate. \n",

    "I made this diagram, using the online software called gliffy.com but you can use other software as well. You'll see this shape is where the user starts, then in the next shape to the right they go to an introduction page and then they do the three scenarios. And then they get to the screen shape which is a rectangle with a double border on the left and right. This rectangle represents the module completion page where the Click to Tweet control is, that's why I made the box green and added a double border, so it stood out. You'll notice that next to this box, I put the total number of pageviews from all the months in our baseline data which was over 10,000, 10,865 to be exact. Next, in the flow comes this diamond shape which is the tweet decision, to tweet or not to tweet? Very philosophical question. So there is a no path and a yes path for the user and then they hit the end of the process. Next to the yes path you will see it the total frequencies for the numerator and denominator of WOM3 from our baseline data. 719 was the numerator and we use that pageview number that was over 10,000 as a denominator. This is actually the overall rate for the whole period which is 7%. This is from the results data I showed you in that spreadsheet from an earlier section. \n",

We could also, somehow, increase the user's incentive to tweet, but how might we do that? Welcome to psychology. This is why, when you learn marketing, it's good to also take psychology and communication classes, because you often end up trying to find ways to improve messaging, and the main way I could think of to try to make people want to tweet more, is to make the message they are tweeting more attractive to tweet. \n",

Maybe we could add a personal message to it that is attractive to the user. \"I'm a better manager because I completed the online \"Management Simulation Module. \"You should try it, too.\" Maybe this adjusted message will create more of a user incentive to send out the tweet. Now that we designed Condition B for our experiment, we need to set a goal for WOM3 in Condition B, our reworded tweet. We know what to expect from Condition A from our baseline data, an overall average of WOM3 of 7%. \n",

A logic model is a diagram showing how you think things cause each other in real life. Imagine a diagram with two circles overlapping, and where they overlap in the middle is labeled compromise. This simple logic model says that someone thinks that compromise happens when one side and another side overlap in their interests.

Now we ask a logical question. \"How do we increase the probability of tweeting?\" Here is what I brainstormed for the answer. \n",
    "- First, I could put the tweet control in a more prominent spot, and make it easier for the user to find it. \n",

And that's how I came up with my strategy, to test what happens if I change the message on the tweet. I decided to make it so that when the user tweets, they feel like they are doing something even better for themselves, than they are right now. Remember, the existing A condition says, \"I completed the online Management Simulation Module. You should try it too.\" I'm proposing to test that against a new B condition message, which is, \"I'm a better manager because I completed the online Management Simulation Module. You should try it too.\" In B, the user is not just telling their colleagues on Twitter, that they are good, but they are saying they are good at the particular topic of the module. In hopes, that will increase their employment or career profile. That's the logic anyway. Do you disagree? Maybe, but at least even if you disagree with me, I have presented this logic model here for you to evaluate, and then, we'll collect the data, and see who is right."

Their classic camera sales were down, so when they launched sales of their new camera they decided to do the social campaign again.

At baseline, the user tries to access some resource, maybe go to a webpage, click on a video or click on a link to fill out a survey. It is this resource that holds the potential of a conversion. If they go to a webpage they can click somewhere on that webpage as a conversion. So what webpages make them click more? Or if they start to watch a video, they could watch all the way to the end as a conversion. So which video makes them want to watch more? Basically, we want to know if changing some characteristic of the resource increases convergence. \n",

What happens in an A/B test is that when the user goes to access that resource, that webpage or that video, the request goes through a software processing layer that makes a decision based on probability, usually 50/50 probability of which version of the resource to present to the user. Now the green box, the one on the left, represents the A condition and the gray box, the one on the right, represents the potentially better B condition. In our scenario, the box on the left labeled A condition would represent the user seeing the webpage with the old tweet language on it and the gray box on the right labeled B condition would represent the user seeing the webpage with the new tweet language on it. \n",

That's the one I'm going to want to keep. If it's the one on the left, the A condition, I can rest easy because I don't have to reprogram my webpage.

That one looked exactly like this, but only had the left side of this flow by the green box with double borders. It did not have the right side flow where the red box with double borders is. Let's look at those two boxes. See how the green box on the left with the double border is the A condition? This is the current condition, and here's our experiment. The red box on the right with the double border represents the B condition. See these lines? This indicates that after that decision should we show the user A or B. There will be a certain number of people who see the A version and a certain number of people who see the B version And I can put those numbers here on those blank lines. They will be the denominators of our conversion rates. Let's look down here. See the tweet decision? In the baseline chapter, I just had the left side, the green side. Now we have two sides, left and right because we are comparing two conditions, A and B. See these question marks, notice that there is a fraction and then a percentage on both sides. The denominator will be at the bottom of the fraction. That will be the number we write in the blank lines above. The numerator will be our conversion frequency. In other words, the number of times they clicked on the click to tweet. And remember I think the B condition will work better because they will be advertising not only that they are more educated after completing the module, but they are better employees.

However, there can always be issues when going from test to live, so keep that in mind. On the other hand, let's say you have no baseline data, you actually have a brand new webpage. This can happen in marketing, where you throw up a page for some new product, and they're just seeking people to be put on a mailing list.

    "So for our scenario, we need a page with tweet A language and a page with tweet B language. And in your testing software, you have to map the page A to one condition and page B to another, and you need to know which is mapped to A and which is mapped to B. Now go to the page multiple times and see if it is switching back and forth between A and B. Are you getting one of them, A or B, most of the time when you are not supposed to? Or are you getting one of them all of the time? You want to make sure the pages are being presented in both A and B condition. Otherwise, you will not be able to gather data about both conditions, simple as that. \n",

    "Now, onto the back-end, this is why we kept documentation. Now we will refer to it to remind ourselves what we are actually doing. Remember, we had baseline data in our scenario. But even if you don't have any baseline data in your situation, you'd have an idea of what your numerator was and what your denominator was going to be. Whatever you decided those are, those measurements are what you are going to look for in the back-end. So that means you are going to have to create test data for your numerator and denominator by interacting with your test front-end. \n",

    "Okay, now that we know what test data we are trying to make when we test our implementation, the next step for testing back-end behavior is using the test front-end to click around and make data in the back-end. If you are in a test environment, this is easy. But I really am a fan of testing in a live environment. If you do that, keep track of the time range in which you do your test. I just love that fourth dimension, which is time. I love time so much, and so do databases and webpages because they tend to store timestamps in their data. That's why even if I am using a development test box, I like to keep track of what server time is when I do my experiment. That way, I can make sure to remove my test cases, and filter in only records with a timestamp during my experiment time. And then I click around, click around, have fun clicking around. But as a tip, just for convenience, I advocate picking a clear winner and a clear loser and trying to make that show up in the data. Let's say you want B to win. Then when you see the B condition, do the conversion, which is Click to Tweet in this case most of the time. A when you see A, avoid converting most of the time, just don't click the Click to Tweet and then go back into the test. Don't always click on your winner. And don't always ignore your loser, but try to heavily favor your winner and heavily avoid your loser. That way, it will be easier for you to find your test data when you go looking for it in the back-end. It might seem like a lot of unnecessary work to go through this exercise of making fake data, and winners and losers. However, I caution you that it is best to prevent any possible errors you can think of in your experiment. You can't go backwards once the experiment starts. \n",

    "As I said before, get your data out of the back-end, and then use the time range and timestamps to filter in the data from just the time you were testing the implementation. In our example, B should win. You should see a way higher conversion rate for B than A, because you made it that way by your behavior. But if you don't see that, you know there is a data collection problem and you can troubleshoot before your experiment goes live."

    "Some of you might be familiar with confidence intervals already. These are ranges you can calculate when you assume your data represents a sample of a larger data set. Like in our scenario we set up our webpage, ran it for a while, and got a baseline 7% conversion rate, which estimates what we'd likely see in another time increment of the same length as the one we observed. So that's a sample. Because it's a sample, 7% is just a point estimate. Statisticians like me like to use a formula to calculate confidence intervals or a range around the point estimate to provide a likely range where the real population-level range might actually be. 7% is just one point estimate. So, I made a graph of this point estimate and I pretended to make a confidence interval around this estimate, and I put that on the graph as well. As seen by the graph I made the example suggests that the population-level conversion rate is somewhere between 2% and 12%, so that's our range. I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with making confidence intervals. \n",

    "In fact, they are simple to calculate by hand and if you know how to calculate them you could make a confidence interval around your baseline rate and that would be useful for you to know. But if you move on to do an experiment and you put a confidence interval around your condition A rate and put another confidence interval around your new B condition rate, where will that get you? That's my issue. \n",

    "I'll explain in detail what I mean. So now, I added to my graph. I pretend that the baseline data was actually our A condition results in the experiment. Next I made up that our B condition rate was 11%. So, compare that to our A condition which was 7%. So tell me, what does this say? Should you convert to B or stick to A? That was a little nursery rhyme for the those of you bringing up our baby future researchers. The absolute value of B's rate is a lot better than A's rate, 11% versus 7%. So it makes me want B. But the confidence intervals overlap. The confidence interval for A is 2% to 12% and for B, it's 6% to 16%, which suggests that both sample A and sample B are drawn from the same population, or to be more technical, they might not be from the exact same population, but each population they are drawn from likely has the same population-level conversion rate. That's what that overlap of confidence intervals means. And actually, we probably would not argue with that at all since our webpage does tend to attract a particular customer base. And it was our software that split the page visitors into A and B conditions, not the visitors themselves. \n",

    "Even if A and B conversion rates come from the same background population, how does this help us decide on which condition to select A or B? This is why I `do not use the confidence interval method for experimental testing`."
