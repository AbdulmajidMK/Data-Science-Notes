    "When we use the term normal distribution in statistics, we usually mean a `probability distribution`. Good examples are the Normal distribution, the Binomial distribution, and the Uniform distribution. **A distribution in statistics is a function** that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur."

    "A hypothesis is an idea that can be tested (compared with something else).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if I tell you that apples in New York are expensive, this is an idea, or a statement, but is not testable, until I have something to compare it with. For instance, if I define expensive as: any price higher than $1.75 dollars per pound, then it immediately becomes a hypothesis."

    "### An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two-sided or а two-tailed test\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple topic that can be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Glassdoor (the popular salary information website), the mean data scientist salary in the US is 113,000 dollars. So, we want to test if their estimate is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two hypotheses that are made: the null hypothesis, denoted H zero, and the alternative hypothesis, denoted H one or H A. The null hypothesis is the one to be tested and the alternative is everything else. In our example,\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis would be: The mean data scientist salary is 113,000 dollars,\n",
    "\n",
    "While the alternative: The mean data scientist salary is not 113,000 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you would want to check if 113,000 is close enough to the true mean, predicted by our sample. In case it is, you would accept the null hypothesis. Otherwise, you would reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the null hypothesis is similar to: innocent until proven guilty. We assume that the mean salary is 113,000 dollars and we try to prove otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One sided or one-tailed test\n",
    "\n",
    "This was an example of a two-sided or а two-tailed test. You can also form one sided or one-tailed tests. Say your friend, Paul, told you that he thinks data scientists earn more than 125,000 dollars per year. You doubt him so you design a test to see who’s right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis of this test would be: The mean data scientist salary is more than 125,000 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative will cover everything else, thus: The mean data scientist salary is less than or equal to 125,000 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that outcomes of tests refer to the population parameter rather than the sample statistic! As such, the result that we get is for the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another crucial consideration is that, generally, the researcher is trying to reject the null hypothesis. Think about the null hypothesis as the status quo and the alternative as the change or innovation that challenges that status quo. In our example, Paul was representing the status quo, which we were challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright. We showed you the four hypothesis testing steps."

    "## Type I and Type II Errors\n",
    "In general, we can have two types of errors – `type I error` and `ype II error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type I error** is when you reject a true null hypothesis and is the more serious error. It is also called `a false positive`. The probability of making this error is `alpha` – the `level of significance`. Since you, the researcher, choose the alpha, the responsibility for making this error lies solely on you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type II error** is when you accept a false null hypothesis. The probability of making this error is denoted by `beta`. Beta depends mainly on sample size and population variance. So, if your topic is difficult to test due to hard sampling or has high variability, it is more likely to make this type of error. As you can imagine, if the data set is hard to test, it is not your fault, so Type II error is considered a smaller problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also mention that the `probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis` is equal to 1 minus beta. This is the researcher’s goal – to reject a false null hypothesis. Therefore, 1 minus beta is called `the power of the test`. Generally, researchers increase the power of a test by increasing the sample size."

    "### An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "You are in love with this girl from the other class, but are unsure if she likes you.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two errors you can make.\n",
    "First, if she likes you back and you don’t invite her out, you are making the type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis in this situation is: she likes you back. It turns out that she really did like you back. Unfortunately, you did not invite her out, because after testing the situation, you wrongly thought the null hypothesis was false. In other words, you made a type I error – you rejected a true null hypothesis and lost your chance. It is a very serious problem, because you could have been made for each other, but you didn’t even try.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine another situation. She doesn’t like you back, but you go and invite her out. The null hypothesis is still: she likes you back, but this time it is false. In reality she doesn’t really like you back, that is. However, after testing, you accept the null hypothesis and wrongly go and invite her out. She tells you she has a boyfriend that is much older, smarter and better at statistics than you and turns her back.\n",
    "\n",
    "You made a type II error – accepted a false null hypothesis. However, it is no big deal, as you go back to your normal life without her and soon forget about this awkward situation."
