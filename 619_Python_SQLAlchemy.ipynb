    "\n",
    "**SQLAlchemy** can be used to automatically load tables from a database using something called **reflection**. **Reflection** is the process of reading the database and building the metadata based on that information. It's the opposite of creating a Table by hand and is very useful for working with existing databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform **reflection**, you will first need to import and initialize a `MetaData` object. MetaData objects contain information about tables stored in a database. During reflection, the MetaData object will be populated with information about the reflected table automatically, so we only need to initialize it before reflecting by calling `MetaData()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to import the `Table` object from the SQLAlchemy package. Then, you use this Table object to read your table from the engine, autoload the columns, and populate the metadata. This can be done with a single call to `Table()`: using the Table object in this manner is a lot like passing arguments to a function. For example, to autoload the columns with the engine, you have to specify the keyword arguments `autoload=True` and `autoload_with=engine` to `Table()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to view information about the object you just created, you will use the `repr()` function. For any Python object, `repr()` returns a text representation of that object. For SQLAlchemy Table objects, it will return the information about that table contained in the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
