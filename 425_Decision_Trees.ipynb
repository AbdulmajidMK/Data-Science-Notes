    "Decision trees have a lot to recommend them. They’re `very easy to understand and interpret`, and the process by which they reach a prediction is completely transparent. Unlike the other models, decision trees `can easily handle a mix of numeric` (e.g., number of legs) `and categorical` (e.g., delicious/not delicious) `attributes and can even classify data for which attributes are missing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, finding an “optimal” decision tree for a set of training data is computationally a very hard problem. (We will get around this by trying to build a goodenough tree rather than an optimal one, although for large data sets this can still be a lot of work.) More important, `it is very easy (and very bad) to build decision trees that are overfitted to the training data`, and that don’t generalize well to unseen data. We’ll look at ways to address this.\n",
