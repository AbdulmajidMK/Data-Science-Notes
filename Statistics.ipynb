    "\n",
    "Statistical models approximate that what generates your data and can be used in data analysis to summarize data, to predict, and to simulate. In other words, it’s a representation of complex phenomena that generated the data, and that can be used for summaries, predictions or simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, however, entails that you also need to be able to find out whether your data fits that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide the best fit between the model and the data estimation can be used. Estimation is concerned with making inferences about a population, based on information obtained from a sample. Next to hypothesis testing, it’s a way of learning something about the population from the sample.\n",
