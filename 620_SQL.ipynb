    "\n",
    "You can think of a **relational database** as a collection of tables. A **table** is just a set of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet, which represents exactly one type of entity. For example, a table might represent employees in a company or purchases made, but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row, or record, of a table contains information about a **single entity**. For example, in a table representing employees, each row represents a single person. Each **column**, or **field,** of a table contains a single attribute for all rows in the table. For example, in a table representing employees, we might have a column containing first and last names for all employees."
