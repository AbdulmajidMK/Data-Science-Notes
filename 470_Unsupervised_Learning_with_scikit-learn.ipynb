    "# Unsupervised Learning with scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a collection of customers with a variety of characteristics such as age, location, and financial history, and you wish to **discover patterns and sort them into clusters**. Or perhaps you have a set of texts, such as wikipedia pages, and you wish to **segment them into categories based on their content**. This is the world of **unsupervised learning**, called as such because you are not guiding, or supervising, the pattern discovery by some prediction task, but instead **uncovering hidden structure from unlabeled data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning** encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this notebook, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using `scikit-learn` and `scipy`. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a **recommender system** to recommend popular musical artists."
