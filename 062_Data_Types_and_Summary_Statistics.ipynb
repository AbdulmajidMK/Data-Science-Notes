    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics** is the science of learning from data. However, there are different types of variables, and they record various kinds of information. Crucially, the type of information determines what you can learn from it, and, importantly, what you cannot learn from it. Consequently, you must understand the different types of data. **Data** carries information that you are gathering for an inquiry. **Data** are evidence you can use to answer questions.\n",

    "### Quantitative versus Qualitative Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative**: The information is recorded as `numbers` and represents an objective measurement or a count. Temperature, weight, and a count of transactions are all quantitative data. Analysts also refer to this type as `numerical data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Continuous** variables can take on any numeric value, and the scale can be meaningfully divided into smaller increments, including fractional and decimal values. There are an infinite number of possible values between any two values. And differences between any two values are always meaningful. Typically, you measure continuous variables on a scale. For example, when you measure height, weight, and tempera- ture, you have continuous data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - **Intervals**: On interval scales, the interval, or distance, between any two points is meaningful. For example, the 20-degree difference between 10 and 30 Celsius is equivalent to the difference between 50 and 70 degrees. However, `these scales don’t have a zero measurement that indicates the lack of the characteristic`. For example, Celsius has a zero measure, but it does not mean there is no temperature.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Due to this lack of a true zero, `measurement ratios are not valid on interval scales`. Thirty degrees Celsius is not three times the temperature as 10 degrees Celsius. **You can add and subtract values on an in-terval scale, but you cannot multiply or divide them**.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **Ratio**: On ratio scales, intervals are still meaningful. Additionally, `these scales have a zero measurement that represents a lack of the property`. For example, zero kilograms indicates a lack of weight. Consequently, measurements ratios are valid for these scales. 30 kg is three times the weight of 10 kg. **You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide values on an interval scale**.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    With continuous variables, you can assess properties such as the `mean`, `median`, `distribution`, `range`, and `standard deviation`. **Continuous variables** allow you to assess the wide variety of properties.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Graphical representations: `histogram`, `scatter plot`, `time series`.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Discrete** quantitative data are a count of the presence of a characteristic, result, item, or activity. These counts are nonnegative integers that cannot be divided into smaller increments. For example, a single household can have 1 or 2 cars, but it cannot have 1.6. There are a finite number of possible values between any two values. Other examples of discrete variables include class sizes, number of candies in a jar, and the number of calls that a call center receives.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    With discrete variables, you can calculate and assess a rate of occurrence or a summary of the count, such as the `mean`, `sum`, and `standard deviation`. For example, U.S. households had an average of 2.11 vehicles in 2014.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Graphical representations: `bar chart`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qualitative**: The information represents characteristics that you do `not measure with numbers`. Instead, observations fall within a countable number of groups. This type of variable can capture information that isn’t easily measured and can be subjective. Taste, eye color, architectural style, and marital status are all types of qualitative variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you record information that categorizes your observations, you are collecting **qualitative data**. There are three types of qualitative variables: **categorical**, **binary**, and **ordinal**. With these data types, you’re often interested in the proportions of each category. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Graphical representations: `bar chart`, `pie chart` (useful for displaying counts and relative percentages of each group).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Categorical** data have values that you can put into a countable number of distinct groups based on a characteristic. For a categorical variable, you can assign categories, but the categories have `no natural order`. Categorical variables can define groups in your data that you want to compare, such as the experimental conditions of treatment and control. Analysts also refer to categorical data as both **attribute** and **nominal** variables. For example, college major is a categorical variable that can have val- ues such as psychology, political science, engineering, biology, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Binary** data can have only two values. If you can place an observation into only two categories, you have a binary variable. Statisticians also refer to binary data as both **dichotomous** data and **indicator** variables. For example, pass/fail, male/female, and the presence/absence of a characteristic are all binary data. From binary variables, analysts can calculate `proportions` or `percentages`, such as the proportion of defective products in a sample. Simply take the number of faulty products and divide by the sample size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Ordinal** data have `at least three categories, and the categories have a natural order`. Examples of ordinal variables include overall status (poor to excellent), agreement (strongly disagree to strongly agree), and rank (such as sporting teams).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Ordinal variables** have a `combination of qualitative and quantitative properties`. On the one hand, these variables have a limited number of discrete values like categorical variables. On the other hand, the differences between the values provides some information like qualitive variables. However, the difference between adjacent values might not be consistent. For example, first, second, and third in a race are ordinal data. The difference in time between first and second place might not be the same the difference between second and third place.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Analysts often represent ordinal variables using numbers, such as a 1-5 Likert scale that measures satisfaction. In number form, you can calculate `average scores` as with quantitative variables. However, `the numbers have limited usefulness because the differences between ranks might not be constant`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where you have a choice about recording a characteristic as a **continuous** or **qualitative** variable, `the best practice is to record the continuous data because you can learn so much more`."

    "### Histograms (1) - Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Histograms** are an excellent way `to graph continuous variables` because they show the distribution of values. Understanding the distribution allows you to determine which values are more and less common amongst other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each histogram bar spans a range of values for the continuous variable on the horizontal X-axis. These ranges are also known as `bins`. The height of each bar represents either the number or proportion of observations that fall within each bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/stat-histogram.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms help in determining whether the distribution is symmetric or skewed (shape of the distribution), understanding the central tendency, spread of values, identifying where the most common values fall, and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use histograms when you have continuous measurements and want to understand the distribution of values and look for outliers. They are fantastic exploratory tools because they reveal properties about your sample data in ways that summary statistics cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `measure of central tendency` is a single value that represents the center point or typical value of a dataset, such as the mean. A `measure of variability` is another type of summary statistic that describes how spread out the values are in your dataset. The standard deviation is a conventional measure of dispersion. Histograms indicate which values occur more and less frequently along with their dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "I always recommend that you graph your data before assessing the numbers. The problem with summary statistics is that they are simplifications of your dataset. Graphing the data brings it to life much more fully and intuitively. Generally, I find that using graphs in conjunction with statistics provides the best of both worlds."
