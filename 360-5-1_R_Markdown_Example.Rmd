```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r options_example, echo = FALSE, message = TRUE)

# A code chunk named "options_example", with argument `echo` assigned FALSE 
# and argument `message` assigned TRUE

# echo = display R code
# message = display any messages from R code
# include = FALSE, if no resoults of the code shoud be included in the code
#           usually used in the beginning of the report used to initial processing work
#           such as library or packages installation
# eval = FALSE, to show R code but do not execute it

# Would execute `R` code in here
```

```r
# code without evaluation
2+3
```

```{r}
# code evaluated
2+3
```

To calculate 3 + 4 inside some text, you can use `r 3 + 4` right in the middle.

```{r raw_print_example, echo = FALSE} 
print("Hello world")
```

```{r}
msg <- "message"
```

This is `r msg` or `msg`.

- aa
- bb
- cc

```{r asis_example, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE} 
cat("**Hello world**")
```

```{r list_example, echo = FALSE} 
markdown_list <- "
- Lions
- Tigers
- Bears
- Oh mys "
```
`r markdown_list`


```{r pasted_list_example, echo = FALSE}
# Create a vector of animals
animals <- c("Lions", "Tigers", "Bears", "Oh mys")
# Paste `-` in front of each animal, then paste the items together with newlines between
markdown_list <- paste("-", animals, collapse = "\n")
```

`r markdown_list`

The package contains numerous helper functions, which render user specified inputs in Pandoc's markdown format or apply some extra formatting on it. http://rapporter.github.io/pander/

```{r kable_example, echo = FALSE}
library("knitr") # make sure you load the package (once per document)
# Make a data frame
letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
numbers <- 1:4
df <- data.frame(letters = letters, numbers = numbers)
# "Return" the table to render it
kable(df)
```

Tables generated with the kable() function can be further customized using additional packages, such as kableExtra. a This package allows you to add more layers and styling to a table using a format similar to how you add labels and themes with ggplot2. http://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/


```{r plot_example, echo = FALSE}
library("ggplot2") # make sure you load the package (once per document)
# Plot of college education vs. poverty rates in the Midwest
ggplot(data = midwest) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = percollege, y = percadultpoverty, color = state)) + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```
