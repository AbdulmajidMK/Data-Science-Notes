    "The insights you discover through your analysis are only valuable if you can share them with others. To do this, it’s important to have a simple, repeatable process for combining the set of charts, tables, and statistics you generate into an easily presentable format.\n",

    "R Markdown does this by providing the ability to blend Markdown syntax and R code so that, when compiled and executed, the results from your code will be automatically injected into a formatted document. The ability to automatically generate reports and documents from a computer script eliminates the need to manually update the results of a data analysis project, enabling you to more effectively share the information that you’ve produced from your data.\n",

    "R Markdown documents are created from a combination of two packages: **[rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)** (which processes the markdown and generates the output) and **[knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)** (which runs R code and produces Markdown-like output). These packages are produced by and already included in RStudio, which provides direct support for creating and viewing R Markdown documents."

    "The knitting process can make it hard to debug errors in your R code (whether syntax or logical), in part because the output may or may not show up in the document! We suggest that you write complex R code in another script and then use the `source()` function to insert that script into your `.Rmd` file and use calculated variables in your output. This makes it possible to test your data processing work outside of the knitted document. It also separates the concerns of the data and its representation - which is good programming practice."
