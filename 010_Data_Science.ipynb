As with photos, remember not to take what you see too seriously. You didn’t take the photos, so you don’t know much about what’s off-screen. The golden rule of data-mining is: stick to what is here. Only make conclusions about what you can see, never about what you can’t see (for that you need statistics and lot more expertise).\n",

It’s just some code that the machine uses to convert inputs into outputs, and could be handcrafted by a programmer or learned from data by an algorithm.\n",

That is the essence of machine learning. It is a completely different programming paradigm. Now, instead of giving explicit instructions, you program with examples and the machine learning algorithm finds patterns in your data and turns them into those instructions you couldn’t write yourself. No more handcrafting of recipes!\n",

    "Imagine that you are considering buying something online instead of making a pilgrimage to the other side of town to fetch it.

Psychologists have a lovely name for this: [**confirmation bias**](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/70c9/3e5e38a8176590f69c0491fd63ab2a9e67c4.pdf).\n",

(With certainty! It’s the p-value you’ve always wanted.)

    "I recently went clothes shopping in Brooklyn with my friend Emma. Showing off a pretty dress, she tugs at the pricetag on the back. “Hey, what does this say?” she asks me. “If it’s less than 80 bucks, I’ll buy it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that’s some decision intelligence! Instead of first seeing the price and then talking herself into a decision she’s already made, she uses the data to drive it. With a well-practiced reflex, she weighs how much she likes the dress and her budget, then sets the decision boundary, and only allows herself to see the data (price) once that’s done. She’s in the habit of using data in the right order and that’s a muscle you can exercise too.\n",
    "\n",
    "People don’t always need to be data-driven and Emma knows that. She doesn’t have to make unimportant decisions that way, but she also knows that practice makes perfect. It’s much easier to build the habit on trivial decisions than to struggle when the important ones come around.\n",

    "### Lessons from negotiation class\n",
    "This idea is not new. Many different courses teach it, though one that’s almost guaranteed to cover it on day 1 is negotiation. If you haven’t put a value on your BATNA (~ a walk-away point) before entering a negotiation, you may as well paint “no idea what I’m doing” on your forehead. It’s the same thing by a different name: figuring out your decision boundary between your default action and the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The antidote is setting your decision criteria in advance.\n",
    "In fact, standard advice for negotiators is to think through the entire range of potential offer combinations and plan your reactions to them in advance, otherwise it’s very easy for an experienced opponent to take advantage of you. Even without all the persuasion tactics at your counterpart’s disposal, irrelevant short-term factors like your blood sugar levels, your mood, how much the other party is smiling, and whether the sun is shining can have a disproportionate effect on the deal. Again, the same goes for data analysis — think of the data as negotiating with you to change your mind. The antidote there is planning your response in advance. Next time you’re negotiating a salary, for example, make sure you’ve thought about your number before you hear theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It’s easy when you get the hang of it\n",
    "Whether you think about what a number means to you before or after you see it, you still have to think about it. Doing it beforehand helps you counter some of the bugs in your human programming, with large payoffs in decision quality and negotiation performance. Improving the order of operations here is a valuable habit to cultivate and crucial if you’d like to be involved in data-driven decision-making. And here’s some bonus good news: with practice it’ll feel automatic."

    "Besides, analytics uses some of the same math, so you wouldn’t be lying if you told your friends you’re using ML/AI algorithms (though you’re not building ML/AI systems). Many people who think they want ML/AI actually only need analytics. The latter is a great idea for all projects, while the former is good for only certain kinds. If you’re unsure, go for the sure thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes business savvy to properly think through what an Ml/AI system is supposed to do for you and why it’s worth building. Focus on this first, before getting anywhere near the nitty gritty, including figuring out whether or not the algorithm that’ll solve your problem is considered AI or ML (you deal with that much later). If you have no ML/AI training, tackling this first part before you’ve hired a team or bought sci-fi kit might sound daunting, but I’ve got your back… here’s a step-by-step guide just for you!\n",

    "### DS Lead\n",
    "Leadership in data science isn’t just leadership with a semester of numbers sprinkled on top. It’s its own strange beast. Not only must you have a deep understanding of decision-making and how information should drive actions, but you need a keen nose for the nuances of how to usefully impact your particular business domain and, as if that weren’t enough, you also need to understand the ecosystem of diverse skills that need to come together to make a large-scale data science project successful. And that’s just the minimum for entry into this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a pretty high bar, and not everyone who leads data science teams meets it. Employers, how do you know if you’re hiring the real deal to lead your data team? What if your team already has bad data science leadership? How could you tell? There’s hardly any wisdom about this role for you to lean on. Whom could you even ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, when I chat with folks across industry, I keep hearing the same story: “Our data scientists are useless! All they do is sit around publishing papers.” Will we have enough skilled leaders to prevent this all-too-common phenomenon? If data scientists don’t prove themselves valuable, they won’t be in those jobs for long.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s unfair to expect that a freshly-minted science PhD knows how to contribute meaningfully to business. That’s not what they spent all those years learning. Without guidance from someone who understands what data science involves and knows how to connect data with the business, the deck is stacked against them. To make sure data science is not a bubble, we urgently need specialized leadership. Where will it come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where are the training programs for data science leaders? Hope is not a strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **data scientist** is only as good as the data they have access to. Most companies store their data in variety of formats across databases and text files. This is where **data engineers** come in — they build pipelines that transform that data into formats that data scientists can use. Data engineers are just as important as data scientists, but tend to be less visible because they tend to be further from the end product of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science field is incredibly broad, encompassing everything from cleaning data to deploying predictive models. However, it’s rare for any single data scientist to be working across the spectrum day to day. Data scientists usually focus on a few areas, and are complemented by a team of other scientists and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data engineering is also a broad field, but any individual data engineer doesn’t need to know the whole spectrum of skills. In this section, we’ll sketch the broad outlines of data engineering, then walk through more specific descriptions that illustrate specific data engineering roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data engineer transforms data into a useful format for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data engineering skills\n",
    "A data engineer needs to be good at:\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecting distributed systems\n",
    "- Creating reliable pipelines\n",
    "- Combining data sources\n",
    "- Architecting data stores\n",
    "- Collaborating with data science teams and building the right solutions for them\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we didn’t mention any tools above. Although tools like Hadoop and Spark and languages like Scala and Python are important to data engineering, it’s more important to understand the concepts well and know how to build real-world systems. We’ll continue this focus on concepts over tools throughout this series on data engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Engineering Roles\n",
    "Although data engineers need to have the skills listed above, the day to day of a data engineer will vary depending on the type of company they work for. Broadly, you can classify data engineers into a few categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generalist\n",
    "- Pipeline-centric\n",
    "- Database-centric\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalist\n",
    "A generalist data engineer typically works on a small team. Without a data engineer, data analysts and scientsts don’t have anything to analyze, making a data engineer a critical first member of a data science team.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a data engineer is the only data-focused person at a company, they usually end up having to do more end-to-end work. For example, a generalist data engineer may have to do everything from ingesting the data to processing it to doing the final analysis. This requires more data science skill than most data engineers have. However, it also requires less systems architecture knowledge — small teams and companies don’t have a ton of users, so engineering for scale isn’t as important. This is a good role for a data scientist who wants to transition into data engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipeline-centric\n",
    "Pipeline-centric data engineers tend to be necessary in mid-sized companies that have complex data science needs. A pipeline-centric data engineer will work with teams of data scientists to transform data into a useful format for analysis. This entails in-depth knowledge of distributed systems and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database-centric\n",
    "A database-centric data engineer is focused on setting up and populating analytics databases. This involves some work with pipelines, but more work with tuning databases for fast analysis and creating table schemas. This involves ETL work to get data into warehouses. This type of data engineer is usually found at larger companies with many data analysts that have their data distributed across databases.\n",

    "## A tale of two machine learnings\n",
    "When people say ‘machine learning’ it sounds like there’s only one discipline here. There are two, and if businesses don’t understand the difference, they can experience a world of trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning research\n",
    "If you build machine learning algorithms, your focus is general purpose tools for others to use. This business is called **machine learning research** and is typically done by places like academia or Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to machine learning, many organizations are in the wrong business.\n",
    "You need quite a lot of education to be in this line of work, because there’s a long history here. Some popular algorithms have been around for centuries. For example, the method of least squares for regression, was published in 1805. Trust me, humanity has come a long way in 200 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, there are some pretty sophisticated appliances out there… how are you going to build a better microwave if you don’t know how this one works? Of course you need all that immersive study! Becoming a researcher takes years and there’s a good reason that the 101 course starts with the basics of calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applied machine learning\n",
    "Most businesses just want to get cooking — to solve their business problems. They have no interest in selling microwaves, and yet often make the mistake of trying to build those appliances from scratch. It’s hard to blame them — the current hype and education cycle dominantly focuses on research, instead of application.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re innovating with recipes, don’t reinvent the wheel. Those microwaves exist already. You can get them for free from many places. And if setting up your own machine learning kitchen sounds like a chore, providers like Google Cloud Platform let you use theirs, complete with appliances, ingredients, and recipe books.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re innovating in the kitchen, don’t reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "For most applications, your team doesn’t need to understand the mathematics of backpropagation in neural networks any more than a chef needs to know the wiring diagram for a microwave. But there’s a lot that you do need to know if you’re planning on running an industrial-scale kitchen, everything from curating your ingredients to checking that your dishes are good before you serve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crashing and burning with machine learning\n",
    "Unfortunately, I see a lot of businesses failing to get value from machine learning because they don’t realize that the applied side is a very different discipline from the algorithms research side. Instead, leaders try to start their kitchens by hiring those folks who’ve been building microwave parts their whole lives but have never cooked a thing. What could possibly go wrong? If that works out, it’s because you got lucky and accidentally hired an engineer who is a great chef.\n",
    "\n",
    "But usually you’re not lucky. There are only so many hours in one lifetime, and if you spend them learning how a microwave is wired, you’ve got fewer to devote to mastering the art of pastry or business. Where — and when! — would your PhD-trained artificial intelligence researcher have gained the skills required for applied machine learning? If you set your heart on the hybrid who’s an expert in both, no wonder you’re complaining about the talent shortage!\n",
    "\n",
    "Whom should you hire instead? Just like in an industrial kitchen, you need an interdisciplinary team with leadership that understands this space. Otherwise, projects fizzle and go nowhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hiring the right team for the job\n",
    "If you’re selling cutting-edge appliances, hire researchers. If you’re innovating in recipes to sell food at scale, you need people who figure out what’s worth cooking / what the objectives are (decision-makers and product managers), people who understand the suppliers and the customers (domain experts and social scientists), people who can process ingredients at scale (data engineers and analysts), people who can try many different ingredient-appliance combinations quickly to generate potential recipes (applied ML engineers), people who can check that the quality of the recipe is good enough to serve (statisticians), people who turn a potential recipe into millions of dishes served efficiently (software engineers), people who keep the interdisciplinary team on track (project/program managers), and people who ensure that your dishes stay top notch even if the delivery truck brings you a ton of potatoes instead of the rice you ordered (reliability engineers).\n",
    "\n",
    "While these needn’t be separate individuals, be sure you’ve got each role covered. And before you fling your rotten tomato at me for providing such an incomplete caricature, I’ll freely admit that there’s much more to say about hiring for applied machine learning. I’ve outsourced that to other posts, including this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of outsourcing, if your team has tried all existing tools and can’t make a recipe that meets your business objectives, it makes sense to think about adding skills in building appliances (researcher). Whether or not you hire that person to your permanent staff or outsource the job to an experienced algorithms research firm depends on the scale and maturity of your operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to connect with researchers is that your prototype is so successful that using custom-built appliances makes sense at the massive scale you’re lucky enough to operate at. (What a great problem to have!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision intelligence\n",
    "Experts should be talking about this, but they aren’t. They’re not owning up to the fact that there’s really two machine learnings here, and so the world is training people in building all these algorithms but not in using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "My team is working to fix that. We’ve created a new discipline to cover the applied side and we’ve already trained over 15,000 staff members in it. We’re calling it [**decision intelligence engineering**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr4P_jCdUFs) (Decision intelligence is an engineering discipline that augments data science with theory from social science, decision theory, and managerial science.), and it spans all the applied aspects of machine learning and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it another way, if research machine learning is building microwaves and applied machine learning is using microwaves, decision intelligence engineering is using microwaves safely to meet your goals and using something else when you don’t need a microwave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good luck and have fun!\n",
    "When it comes to applied machine learning, the hardest part is knowing what you want to cook and how you plan to check it before you serve it to your customers. That part is actually not that hard — just don’t forget to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the rest, solving business problems with machine learning is far easier than most people think. Those gleaming kitchens are waiting for you to come play in them. Dive in as you would in a real kitchen. Start tinkering! Every time I meet someone who believes they need to take a traditional machine learning algorithms course — or, goodness! a whole degree — in order to get started, I can’t help but imagine them refusing to use microwaves until they built one themselves. Don’t fall for the lie that says you need a PhD to do amazing things with machine learning. Instead, what you really need is a bit of human creativity. Good luck and have fun!"
