    "# School Budgets: Use Data to Have a Social Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science isn't just for predicting ad-clicks-it's also useful for social impact! This course is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. You'll explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By **building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget**, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. In this course, you'll begin by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. In particular, you'll do some **natural language processing** to prepare the budgets for modeling. Next, you'll have the opportunity to try your own techniques and see how they compare to participants from the competition. Finally, you'll see how the winner was able to combine a number of expert techniques to build the most accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to be working with school district budget data. This data can be classified in many ways according to certain labels, e.g. Function: Career & Academic Counseling, or Position_Type: Librarian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to develop a model that predicts the probability for each possible label by relying on some correctly labeled examples. We have ourselves a **multi-class-multi-label classification problem**, because there are 9 broad categories that each take on many possible sub-label instances."

    "Now it's time to check out the dataset! You'll use pandas (which has been pre-imported as pd) to load your data into a DataFrame and then do some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is available as TrainingData.csv. Your first task is to load it into a DataFrame in the IPython Shell using pd.read_csv() along with the keyword argument index_col=0.\n",

    "Use methods such as .info(), .head(), and .tail() to explore the budget data and the properties of the features and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the column names correspond to features - descriptions of the budget items - such as the Job_Title_Description column. The values in this column tell us if a budget item is for a teacher, custodian, or other employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some columns correspond to the budget item labels you will be trying to predict with your model. For example, the Object_Type column describes whether the budget item is related classroom supplies, salary, travel expenses, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use df.info() in the IPython Shell to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "How many rows are there in the training data?\n",
    "How many columns are there in the training data?\n",
    "How many non-null entries are in the Job_Title_Description column?"
