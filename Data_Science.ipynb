    "If you don’t know what decisions you want to make yet, the best you can do is go out there in search of inspiration. That’s called data-mining or analytics or descriptive analytics or exploratory data analysis (EDA) or knowledge discovery (KD), depending on which crowd you hung out with during your impressionable years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Golden rule of analytics: only make conclusions about what you can see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you know how you intend to frame your decision-making, start here. The great news is that this one is easy. Think of your dataset as a bunch of negatives you found in a darkroom. Data-mining is about working the equipment to expose all the images as quickly as possible so you can see whether there’s anything inspiring on them. As with photos, remember not to take what you see too seriously. You didn’t take the photos, so you don’t know much about what’s off-screen. The golden rule of data-mining is: stick to what is here. Only make conclusions about what you can see, never about what you can’t see (for that you need statistics and lot more expertise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The darkroom’s intimidating at first, but there’s not that much to it. Just learn to work the equipment. Here’s a tutorial in R and here’s one in Python to get you started. You can call yourself a data analyst as soon as you start having fun and you can call yourself an expert analyst when you’re able to expose photos (and all the other kinds of datasets) with lightning speed.\n",

    "Machine learning is a thing-labeler, essentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to popular belief, machine learning is not a magical box of magic, nor is it the reason for $30bn in VC funding. At its core, machine learning is just a thing-labeler, taking your description of something and telling you what label it should get.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just took in some pretty complex data through your senses and, as if by magic, you labeled it ‘cat.’ That was so easy for you! How about if we wanted a computer to do the same task, to classify (label) photos as cat/not-cat?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a new programming paradigm, a new way of communicating your wishes to a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the traditional programming approach, a programmer would think hard about the pixels and the labels, communicate with the universe, channel inspiration, and finally handcraft a model. A model’s just a fancy word for recipe, or a set of instructions your computer has to follow to turn pixels into labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **model** is a recipe that a computer uses to turn data into labels. It’s just some code that the machine uses to convert inputs into outputs, and could be handcrafted by a programmer or learned from data by an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "But think about what those instructions would be. What are you actually doing with these pixels? Can you express it? Your brain had the benefit of eons of evolution and now it just works, you don’t even know how does it. That recipe is pretty hard to come up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain with examples, not instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn’t it be better if you could just say to the computer, “Here, look at a bunch of examples of cats, look at a bunch of examples of not-cats, and just figure it out yourself”? That is the essence of machine learning. It is a completely different programming paradigm. Now, instead of giving explicit instructions, you program with examples and the machine learning algorithm finds patterns in your data and turns them into those instructions you couldn’t write yourself. No more handcrafting of recipes!\n",
    "\n",
    "AI allows you to automate the ineffable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is that exciting? This is about expressing our wishes to computers in a way we couldn’t before. We love to get computers to do stuff for us. But how can we possibly give instructions if the instructions are really hard to think up? If they’re ineffable?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI and machine learning are about automating the ineffable. They’re about explaining yourself using examples instead of instructions. This unlocks a huge class of tasks that we couldn’t get computers to help us with in the past because we couldn’t express the instructions. Now all of these tasks become possible — machine learning represents a fundamental leap in human progress. It is the future and the future is here!\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning uses patterns in data to label things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally in ML, we like sticks more than carrots — the points are penalties for mistakes (getting a label on the wrong side of the fence) and the game is to get as few of these bad points as possible. That’s why the objective function in ML tends to be called a **“loss function”** and the goal is to minimize loss.\n",

    "Optimization nerds will tell you that rotating the fence in tiny increments is certifiably lame (sorry for tricking you into it!) and there are much better ways to get to the optimal position faster. Some researchers devote their whole lives to coming up with ways to get the best fence position in fewest hops, no matter how perverse the terrain (determined by your inputs) becomes.\n",

    "When we pick these gobbledygook names, we are simply picking the shape of the boundary that we are drawing between the labels. Do we want to separate them with one diagonal line or many horizontal/vertical lines or flexible squigglers… or something else? There are lots and lots of algorithms to pick from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms for hipsters\n",
    "These days, no data science hipster is into the humble straight line. Flexible, squiggly shapes are all the rage among today’s fashionable crowd (you may know these as neural networks, though there isn’t much that’s neural about them — they were named rather aspirationally more than half a century ago and no one seems to like my suggestion that we rename them to “yoga networks” or “many-layers-of-mathematical-operations”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Those gobbledygook algorithm names tell you what shape of fence they’re going try to put in your data. If you’re an applied machine learning enthusiast, it’s okay if you don’t memorize them — in practice you’ll just shove your data through as many algorithms as you can and iterate on what seems promising. The proof of the pudding’s always in the eating… so let’s eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you study the textbook, you won’t get the solution right on your first try. Don’t sweat it. This isn’t a game with one right answer and no one gets their solution on the first try. Give yourself permission to tinker, dabble, and play. The proof of machine learning pudding’s in the eating — does it work on new data? Leave the “how does it work” for researchers who design new algorithms. (And you’ll probably end up getting familiar with those names the same way you learned the characters of whichever bad soap opera haunts your town’s TV screens. Against your will. Give it time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Once the fence in place, the algorithm is finished and what you get out of it is what you wanted along: a model, which is just a fancy word for recipe.

    "\n",
    "The proof of the pudding is in the eating.\n",
    "Test your system by running a bunch of new data through it and make sure it performs well on it. In fact, do that anyway, regardless of whether an algorithm or a programmer came up with that recipe for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML models vs traditional code\n",
    "I’d like to point out that the recipe isn’t all that different from code that a programmer might have written by eyeballing the problem and manually making up some rules. Quit anthropomorphizing machine learning already. A model is conceptually the same kind of thing as regular code. You know, the kind of recipe that’s handcrafted by some human armed with an opinion and a caffeine source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quit anthropomorphizing machine learning already.\n",
    "\n",
    "And don’t go around saying that retraining — jargon for rerunning the algorithm to adjust the boundary as new examples are gathered — makes it creature-like or inherently different from your programmer’s standard work product. Humans can sit there tweaking the code in response to new info too. If you’re worried that your machine learning system now does the update much faster, invest in good testing or avail yourself of a long time.sleep().\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is this all there is to it?\n",
    "Yeah, pretty much. The hard part of ML engineering is installing packages and then wrangling your hairy beast of a dataset so a finicky algorithm deigns to run on it. This is followed by an eternity of fiddling with the code settings (don’t let the noble name “hyperparameter tuning” fool you) until voila! A model! One that turns out not to work when you evaluate its performance on new data… and you’re back to the drawing board, over and over, until finally the heavens open up and your solution stops embarrassing itself. That’s why it’s so important to hire failure-tolerant personalities for this endeavor.\n",

Machine learning may be prosaic, but what you can do with it is incredible! It lets helps you write the code you couldn’t come up with yourself, allowing you to automate the ineffable.

    "\n",
    "### Data Science Team\n",
    "Applied data science is a team sport that’s highly interdisciplinary. Diversity of perspective matters! In fact, perspective and attitude matter at least as much as education and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Engineer\n",
    "We start counting at zero, of course, since you need to have the ability to get data before it makes sense to talk about data analysis. If you’re dealing with small datasets, data engineering is essentially entering some numbers into a spreadsheet. When you operate at a more impressive scale, data engineering becomes a sophisticated discipline in its own right. Someone on your team will need to take responsibility for dealing with the tricky engineering aspects of delivering data that the rest of your staff can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Maker\n",
    "Before hiring that PhD-trained data scientist, make sure you have a decision-maker who understands the art and science of data-driven decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision-making skills have to be in place before a team can get value out of data.\n",
    "This individual is responsible for identifying decisions worth making with data, framing them (everything from designing metrics to calling the shots on statistical assumptions), and determining the required level of analytical rigor based on potential impact on the business. Look for a deep thinker who doesn’t keep saying, “Oh, whoops, that didn’t even occur to me as I was thinking through this decision.” They’ve already thought of it. And that. And that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analyst\n",
    "Then the next hire is… everyone already working with you. Everyone is qualified to look at data and get inspired, the only thing that might be missing is a bit of familiarity with software that’s well-suited for the job. If you’ve ever looked at a digital photograph, you’ve done data visualization and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to use tools like R and Python is just an upgrade over MS Paint for data visualization; they’re simply more versatile tools for looking at a wider variety of datasets than just red-green-blue pixel matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve ever looked at a digital photograph, you’ve done data visualization and analytics. It’s the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember is that you shouldn’t come to conclusions beyond your data. That takes specialist training. Just as with the photo above, here’s all you can say about it: “This is what is in my dataset.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expert Analyst\n",
    "Enter the lightning-fast version! This person can look at more data faster. The game here is speed, exploration, discovery… fun! (Another term for analytics is data-mining.) This is not the role concerned with rigor and careful conclusions. Instead, this is the person who helps your team get eyes on as much of your data as possible so that your decision-maker can get a sense of what’s worth pursuing with more care.\n",
    "\n",
    "The job here is speed, encountering potential insights as quickly as possible.\n",
    "This may be counterintuitive, but don’t staff this role with your most reliable engineers who write gorgeous, robust code. The job here is speed, encountering potential insights as quickly as possible, and unfortunately those who obsess over code quality may find it too difficult to zoom through the data fast enough to be useful in this role.\n",

    "Those who obsess over code quality may find it difficult to be useful in this role.\n",

If fast-but-sloppy coders don’t get much love, they’ll leave your company and you’ll wonder why you don’t have a finger on the pulse of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistician\n",
    "Now that we’ve got all these folks cheerfully exploring data, we’d better have someone around to put a damper on the feeding frenzy. It’s safe to look at that “photo” of Nessie as long as you have the discipline to keep yourself from learning more than what’s actually there… but do you? While people are pretty good at thinking reasonably about photos, other data types seem to send common sense out the window. It might be a good idea to have someone around who can prevent the team from making unwarranted conclusions.\n",

    "Lifehack: don’t make conclusions and you won’t need to worry. I’m only half-joking. Inspiration is cheap, but rigor is expensive. Pay up or content yourself with mere inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians help decision-makers come to conclusions safely beyond the data.\n",
    "For example, if your machine learning system worked in one dataset, all you can safely conclude is that it worked in that dataset. Will it work when it’s running in production? Should you launch it? You need some extra skills to deal with those questions. Statistical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we’re want to make serious decisions where we don’t have perfect facts, let’s slow down and take a careful approach. Statisticians help decision-makers come to conclusions safely beyond the data analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applied Machine Learning Engineer\n",
    "An applied AI / machine learning engineer’s best attribute is not an understanding of how algorithms work. Their job is to use them, not build them. (That’s what researchers do.) Expertise at wrangling code that gets existing algorithms to accept and churn through your datasets is what you’re looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides quick coding fingers, look for a personality that can cope with failure. You almost never know what you’re doing, even if you think you do. You run the data through a bunch of algorithms as quickly as possible and see if it seems to be working… with the reasonable expectation that you’ll fail a lot before you succeed. A huge part of the job is dabbling blindly, and it takes a certain kind of personality to enjoy that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfectionists tend to struggle as ML engineers.\n",
    "Because your business problem’s not in a textbook, you can’t know in advance what will work, so you can’t expect to get a perfect result on the first go. That’s okay, just try lots of approaches as quickly as possible and iterate towards a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of “running the data through algorithms”… what data? The inputs your analysts identified as potentially interesting, of course. That’s why analysts make sense as an earlier hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there’s a lot of tinkering, it’s important for the machine learning engineer to have a deep respect for the part of the process where rigor is vital: assessment. Does the solution actually work on new data? Luckily, you made a wise choice with your previous hire, so all you have to do is pass the baton to the statistician.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest applied ML engineers have a very good sense of how long it takes to apply various approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a potential ML hire can rank options by the time it takes to try them on various kinds of datasets, be impressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Scientist (#6)\n",
    "The way I use the word, a data scientist is someone who is a full expert in all of the three preceding roles. Not everyone uses my definition: you’ll see job applications out there with people calling themselves “data scientist” when they have only really mastered one of the three, so it’s worth checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientist are full experts in all of the three previous roles.\n",
    "This role is in position #6 because hiring the true three-in-one is an expensive option. If you can hire one within budget, it’s a great idea, but if you’re on a tight budget, consider upskilling and growing your existing single-role specialists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytics Manager / Data Science Leader\n",
    "The analytics manager is the goose that lays the golden egg: they’re a hybrid between the data scientist and the decision-maker. Their presence on the team acts as a force-multiplier, ensuring that your data science team isn’t off in the weeds instead of adding value to your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision-maker + data scientist hybrid is a force-multiplier. Unfortunately, they’re rare and hard to hire.\n",
    "This person is kept awake at night by questions like, “How do we design the right questions? How do we make decisions? How do we best allocate our experts? What’s worth doing? Will the skills and data match the requirements? How do we ensure good input data?”\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re lucky enough to hire one of these, hold on to them and never let them go.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Qualitative Expert / Social Scientist\n",
    "Sometimes your decision-maker is a brilliant leader, manager, motivator, influencer, or navigator of organizational politics… but unskilled in the art and science of decision-making. Decision-making is so much more than a talent. If your decision-maker hasn’t honed their craft, they might do more damage than good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of firing an unskilled decision-maker, you can augment them with a qualitative expert.\n",
    "Don’t fire an unskilled decision-maker, augment them. You can hire them an upgrade in the form of a helper. The qualitative expert is here to supplement their skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "This person typically has a social science and data background — behavioral economists, neuroeconomists, and JDM psychologists receive the most specialized training, but self-taught folk can also be good at it. The job is to help the decision maker clarify ideas, examine all the angles, and turn ambiguous intuitions into well-thought-through instructions in language that makes it easy for the rest of the team to execute on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t realize how valuable social scientists are. They’re usually better equipped than data scientists to translate the intuitions and intentions of a decision-maker into concrete metrics.\n",
    "The qualitative expert doesn’t call any of the shots. Instead, they ensure that the decision-maker has fully grasped the shots available for calling. They’re also a trusted advisor, a brainstorming companion, and a sounding board for a decision-maker. Having them on board is a great way to ensure that the project starts out in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Researcher\n",
    "Many hiring managers think their first team member needs to be the ex-professor, but actually you don’t need those PhD folk unless you already know that the industry is not going to supply the algorithms that you need. Most teams won’t know that in advance, so it makes more sense to do things in the right order: before building yourself that space pen, first check whether a pencil will get the job done. Get started first and if you find that the available off-the-shelf solutions aren’t giving you much love, then you should consider hiring researchers.\n",

    "Don’t bring them in right off the bat. It’s better to wait until your team is developed enough to have figured out that what they need a researcher for. Wait till you’ve exhausted all the available tools before hiring someone to build you expensive new ones.\n",

    "#### Additional personnel\n",
    "Besides the roles we looked at, here are some of my favorite people to welcome to a decision intelligence project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Domain expert\n",
    "- Ethicist\n",
    "- Software engineer\n",
    "- Reliability engineer\n",
    "- UX designer\n",
    "- Interactive visualizer / graphic designer\n",
    "- Data collection specialist\n",
    "- Data product manager\n",
    "- Project / program manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Many projects can’t do without them — the only reason they aren’t listed in my top 10 is that decision intelligence is not their primary business. Instead, they are geniuses at their own discipline and have learned enough about data and decision-making to be remarkably useful to your project. Think of them as having their own major or specialization, but enough love for decision intelligence that they chose to minor in it.\n",

    "### Begin with the decision-maker\n",
    "Leaders, figure out who’s calling the shots. If it’s you, then let’s designate you The Decision-Maker for this project. Otherwise, delegate the position to someone else and ask them to read the rest of this while you play outside in the sunshine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right first step is to focus on outputs and objectives. The right time to think about your goals is at the very beginning, while your project is still a puppy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Define success!\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytics might a better fit for you\n",
    "Applied AI requires you to have to have a very clear vision of what your model needs to grow up into (and why), then you have to train it towards that. If you don’t know what you want, head to the font of inspiration instead: analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spend some time figuring out what looks promising enough to pursue, then come back to machine learning when you’re ready.\n",
    "Besides, analytics uses some of the same math, so you wouldn’t be lying if you told your friends you’re using ML/AI algorithms (though you’re not building ML/AI systems). Many people who think they want ML/AI actually only need analytics. The latter is a great idea for all projects, while the former is good for only certain kinds. If you’re unsure, go for the sure thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes business savvy to properly think through what an Ml/AI system is supposed to do for you and why it’s worth building. Focus on this first, before getting anywhere near the nitty gritty, including figuring out whether or not the algorithm that’ll solve your problem is considered AI or ML (you deal with that much later). If you have no ML/AI training, tackling this first part before you’ve hired a team or bought sci-fi kit might sound daunting, but I’ve got your back… here’s a step-by-step guide just for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DS Lead\n",
    "Leadership in data science isn’t just leadership with a semester of numbers sprinkled on top. It’s its own strange beast. Not only must you have a deep understanding of decision-making and how information should drive actions, but you need a keen nose for the nuances of how to usefully impact your particular business domain and, as if that weren’t enough, you also need to understand the ecosystem of diverse skills that need to come together to make a large-scale data science project successful. And that’s just the minimum for entry into this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a pretty high bar, and not everyone who leads data science teams meets it. Employers, how do you know if you’re hiring the real deal to lead your data team? What if your team already has bad data science leadership? How could you tell? There’s hardly any wisdom about this role for you to lean on. Whom could you even ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, when I chat with folks across industry, I keep hearing the same story: “Our data scientists are useless! All they do is sit around publishing papers.” Will we have enough skilled leaders to prevent this all-too-common phenomenon? If data scientists don’t prove themselves valuable, they won’t be in those jobs for long.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s unfair to expect that a freshly-minted science PhD knows how to contribute meaningfully to business. That’s not what they spent all those years learning. Without guidance from someone who understands what data science involves and knows how to connect data with the business, the deck is stacked against them. To make sure data science is not a bubble, we urgently need specialized leadership. Where will it come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where are the training programs for data science leaders? Hope is not a strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **data scientist** is only as good as the data they have access to. Most companies store their data in variety of formats across databases and text files. This is where **data engineers** come in — they build pipelines that transform that data into formats that data scientists can use. Data engineers are just as important as data scientists, but tend to be less visible because they tend to be further from the end product of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science field is incredibly broad, encompassing everything from cleaning data to deploying predictive models. However, it’s rare for any single data scientist to be working across the spectrum day to day. Data scientists usually focus on a few areas, and are complemented by a team of other scientists and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data engineering is also a broad field, but any individual data engineer doesn’t need to know the whole spectrum of skills. In this section, we’ll sketch the broad outlines of data engineering, then walk through more specific descriptions that illustrate specific data engineering roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data engineer transforms data into a useful format for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data engineering skills\n",
    "A data engineer needs to be good at:\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecting distributed systems\n",
    "- Creating reliable pipelines\n",
    "- Combining data sources\n",
    "- Architecting data stores\n",
    "- Collaborating with data science teams and building the right solutions for them\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we didn’t mention any tools above. Although tools like Hadoop and Spark and languages like Scala and Python are important to data engineering, it’s more important to understand the concepts well and know how to build real-world systems. We’ll continue this focus on concepts over tools throughout this series on data engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Engineering Roles\n",
    "Although data engineers need to have the skills listed above, the day to day of a data engineer will vary depending on the type of company they work for. Broadly, you can classify data engineers into a few categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generalist\n",
    "- Pipeline-centric\n",
    "- Database-centric\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalist\n",
    "A generalist data engineer typically works on a small team. Without a data engineer, data analysts and scientsts don’t have anything to analyze, making a data engineer a critical first member of a data science team.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a data engineer is the only data-focused person at a company, they usually end up having to do more end-to-end work. For example, a generalist data engineer may have to do everything from ingesting the data to processing it to doing the final analysis. This requires more data science skill than most data engineers have. However, it also requires less systems architecture knowledge — small teams and companies don’t have a ton of users, so engineering for scale isn’t as important. This is a good role for a data scientist who wants to transition into data engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipeline-centric\n",
    "Pipeline-centric data engineers tend to be necessary in mid-sized companies that have complex data science needs. A pipeline-centric data engineer will work with teams of data scientists to transform data into a useful format for analysis. This entails in-depth knowledge of distributed systems and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database-centric\n",
    "A database-centric data engineer is focused on setting up and populating analytics databases. This involves some work with pipelines, but more work with tuning databases for fast analysis and creating table schemas. This involves ETL work to get data into warehouses. This type of data engineer is usually found at larger companies with many data analysts that have their data distributed across databases.\n",

    "## A tale of two machine learnings\n",
    "When people say ‘machine learning’ it sounds like there’s only one discipline here. There are two, and if businesses don’t understand the difference, they can experience a world of trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning research\n",
    "If you build machine learning algorithms, your focus is general purpose tools for others to use. This business is called **machine learning research** and is typically done by places like academia or Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to machine learning, many organizations are in the wrong business.\n",
    "You need quite a lot of education to be in this line of work, because there’s a long history here. Some popular algorithms have been around for centuries. For example, the method of least squares for regression, was published in 1805. Trust me, humanity has come a long way in 200 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, there are some pretty sophisticated appliances out there… how are you going to build a better microwave if you don’t know how this one works? Of course you need all that immersive study! Becoming a researcher takes years and there’s a good reason that the 101 course starts with the basics of calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applied machine learning\n",
    "Most businesses just want to get cooking — to solve their business problems. They have no interest in selling microwaves, and yet often make the mistake of trying to build those appliances from scratch. It’s hard to blame them — the current hype and education cycle dominantly focuses on research, instead of application.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re innovating with recipes, don’t reinvent the wheel. Those microwaves exist already. You can get them for free from many places. And if setting up your own machine learning kitchen sounds like a chore, providers like Google Cloud Platform let you use theirs, complete with appliances, ingredients, and recipe books.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re innovating in the kitchen, don’t reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "For most applications, your team doesn’t need to understand the mathematics of backpropagation in neural networks any more than a chef needs to know the wiring diagram for a microwave. But there’s a lot that you do need to know if you’re planning on running an industrial-scale kitchen, everything from curating your ingredients to checking that your dishes are good before you serve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crashing and burning with machine learning\n",
    "Unfortunately, I see a lot of businesses failing to get value from machine learning because they don’t realize that the applied side is a very different discipline from the algorithms research side. Instead, leaders try to start their kitchens by hiring those folks who’ve been building microwave parts their whole lives but have never cooked a thing. What could possibly go wrong? If that works out, it’s because you got lucky and accidentally hired an engineer who is a great chef.\n",
    "\n",
    "But usually you’re not lucky. There are only so many hours in one lifetime, and if you spend them learning how a microwave is wired, you’ve got fewer to devote to mastering the art of pastry or business. Where — and when! — would your PhD-trained artificial intelligence researcher have gained the skills required for applied machine learning? If you set your heart on the hybrid who’s an expert in both, no wonder you’re complaining about the talent shortage!\n",
    "\n",
    "Whom should you hire instead? Just like in an industrial kitchen, you need an interdisciplinary team with leadership that understands this space. Otherwise, projects fizzle and go nowhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hiring the right team for the job\n",
    "If you’re selling cutting-edge appliances, hire researchers. If you’re innovating in recipes to sell food at scale, you need people who figure out what’s worth cooking / what the objectives are (decision-makers and product managers), people who understand the suppliers and the customers (domain experts and social scientists), people who can process ingredients at scale (data engineers and analysts), people who can try many different ingredient-appliance combinations quickly to generate potential recipes (applied ML engineers), people who can check that the quality of the recipe is good enough to serve (statisticians), people who turn a potential recipe into millions of dishes served efficiently (software engineers), people who keep the interdisciplinary team on track (project/program managers), and people who ensure that your dishes stay top notch even if the delivery truck brings you a ton of potatoes instead of the rice you ordered (reliability engineers).\n",
    "\n",
    "While these needn’t be separate individuals, be sure you’ve got each role covered. And before you fling your rotten tomato at me for providing such an incomplete caricature, I’ll freely admit that there’s much more to say about hiring for applied machine learning. I’ve outsourced that to other posts, including this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of outsourcing, if your team has tried all existing tools and can’t make a recipe that meets your business objectives, it makes sense to think about adding skills in building appliances (researcher). Whether or not you hire that person to your permanent staff or outsource the job to an experienced algorithms research firm depends on the scale and maturity of your operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to connect with researchers is that your prototype is so successful that using custom-built appliances makes sense at the massive scale you’re lucky enough to operate at. (What a great problem to have!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision intelligence\n",
    "Experts should be talking about this, but they aren’t. They’re not owning up to the fact that there’s really two machine learnings here, and so the world is training people in building all these algorithms but not in using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "My team is working to fix that. We’ve created a new discipline to cover the applied side and we’ve already trained over 15,000 staff members in it. We’re calling it [**decision intelligence engineering**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr4P_jCdUFs) (Decision intelligence is an engineering discipline that augments data science with theory from social science, decision theory, and managerial science.), and it spans all the applied aspects of machine learning and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it another way, if research machine learning is building microwaves and applied machine learning is using microwaves, decision intelligence engineering is using microwaves safely to meet your goals and using something else when you don’t need a microwave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good luck and have fun!\n",
    "When it comes to applied machine learning, the hardest part is knowing what you want to cook and how you plan to check it before you serve it to your customers. That part is actually not that hard — just don’t forget to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the rest, solving business problems with machine learning is far easier than most people think. Those gleaming kitchens are waiting for you to come play in them. Dive in as you would in a real kitchen. Start tinkering! Every time I meet someone who believes they need to take a traditional machine learning algorithms course — or, goodness! a whole degree — in order to get started, I can’t help but imagine them refusing to use microwaves until they built one themselves. Don’t fall for the lie that says you need a PhD to do amazing things with machine learning. Instead, what you really need is a bit of human creativity. Good luck and have fun!"
