    "- [MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters (2004)](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf) - MapReduce is a two-step algorithm. It accepts input data as a key/value store, or creates a key, as part of `the Map step`. The Map step determines all of the values associated with a key; for instance, all the web pages that contain a word. This step is highly parallelizable. `The Reduce step` takes all output of the Map jobs and creates the final dataset linking documents to words. The algorithm is designed from the start to distribute work among large numbers of computers. MapReduce's opensource implementation is Hadoop. \n",
    "\n",
    "    In 2009 [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) extended MR algorithm so that you can set up any kind of pipeline you like with key/value algorithms. Hadoop traditionally processed data in big batches. For modern needs a streaming (fast) data must be processed in near real-time fashion, so additional tools were added to the picture, like [Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) and [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/). These tools separate the streams into managable chunks for processing effectively, creating microbatches of data called `windows`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Containers**. Modern programming involves dividing programs into small modules that do individual, well-defined services and expose the services through APIs (`microservices`). `Virtual machines` (WMs) and `containers` have become important because the microservices don't need a full computer system, so running many of them on each single chip can save a lot of hardware. In addition, each service may be created and torn down quickly, or fail and be replced automatically.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is by far the most popular container platform. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. There are many other tools for administering and providing resources (`orchestration`).\n",
