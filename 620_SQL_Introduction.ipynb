    "`The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights.` Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables called **relational databases**. To be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called **SQL**. This course teaches syntax in SQL shared by many types of databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with databases today!"
